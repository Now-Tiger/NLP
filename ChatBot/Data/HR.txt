what is human resource management? - hrm definitions - functions - objectives - evolution of hrm from personnel managementhuman resource management is the process of recruiting, selecting, inducting employees, providing orientation, imparting training and development, appraising the performance of employees, deciding compensation and providing benefits, motivating employees, maintaining proper relations with employees and their trade unions, ensuring employees safety, welfare and healthy measures in compliance with labour laws of the land and finally following the orders / judgements of the concern high court and supreme court, if any.human resource management deals with the management functions like planning, organizing, directing and controllingit deals with procurement of human resource , training & development and maintenance of human resource.it helps to achieve individual, organizational and social objectiveshuman resource management is a multidisciplinary subject.it includes the study of management, psychology, communication, economics and sociology.it also deals with building team spirit and team work.it is a continuous process.human resource management as a department in an organisation handles all aspects of employees and has various functions like  human resource planning, conducting job analysis, recruitment and conducting job interviews, selection of human resources, orienting, training, compensating, providing benefits and incentives, appraising, retaining, career planning, quality of work life, employee discipline,  black out sexual harassments, human resource auditing, maintenance of industrial relationship, looking after welfare of employees and safety issues , communicating with all employees at all levels and maintaining awareness of and compliance with local, state and federal labor laws.the historical rule of thumb for human resource staffing requirements is one full-time professional human resource person should be hired for every 100 employees. the actual ratio for a business can vary depending upon factors such as the degree of hr centralization, the geographic distribution of the employees served, the sophistication level of the employees, and the relative complexity of the organization.what is the importance of human resource?behind production of every product or service there is an human mind, effort and man hours (working hours). no product or service can be produced without help of human being. human being is fundamental resource for making or construction of anything. every organisation desire is to have skilled and competent people to make their organisation competent and best.among the five ms of management, i.e., men, money, machines, materials, and methods, hrm deals about the first m, which is men. it is believed that in the five ms, "men" is  not so easy to manage. "every man is different from other" and they are totally different from the other ms in the sense that men possess the power to manipulate the other ms. whereas, the other ms are either lifeless or abstract and as such, do not have the power to think and decide what is good for them.why do we call it as human resource management?human: refers to the skilled workforce in an organization.resource: refers to limited availability or scarce.management: refers  how to optimize  and make best use of such limited or scarce resource so as to meet the organization goals and objectives.therefore, human resource management is meant for proper utilisation of  available skilled workforce and also to make efficient use of existing human resource in the organisation. the best example in present situation is, construction industry has been facing serious shortage of skilled workforce. it is  expected to triple in the next decade from the present 30 per cent, will negatively impact the overall productivity of the sector, warn industry experts.today many experts claim that machines and technology are replacing human resource and minimizing their role or effort. however, machines and technology are built by the humans only and they need to be operated or at least monitored by humans and this is the reason why companies are always in hunt  for talented, skilled and qualified professionals for continuous development of the organization.therefore humans are crucial assets for any organisation, although today many tasks have been handing over to the artificial intelligence but they lack judgement skills which cannot be matched with human mind."the automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining" -british theoretical physicist stephen hawkingit is undisputed fact that humans are being replaced by artificial intelligence which are in the form of robots. but all jobs cannot be handed over to robots, to say in other words robots have its own limitations and all roles cannot be handled by robots. though  british theoretical physicist stephen hawking, cambridge professor expressed about destruction of middle-class jobs due to raise of artificial intelligence, he still felt that natural intelligence or need for application of human mind is inevitable in certain roles.great quotations on human resource"you must treat your employees with respect and dignity because in the most automated factory in the world, you need the power of human mind. that is what brings in innovation. if you want high quality minds to work for you, then you must protect the respect and dignity. " -mr n.r. narayana murthy, chairman emeritus, infosys ltd.“our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. the human mind is our fundamental resource.”  - john f. kennedy (35th president of the united states).introduction to hrmhuman resource managementscope of human resource managementhuman resource management functionshuman resource management modelhuman resource developmenthuman capital managementrecruitment of the employeeshuman resource planninginduction of employeeperformance appraisalhuman resource audittraining and developmentjob analysisemployee turnoverquality of work lifeemployee benefits introductionhuman resource management definitionsmany great scholars had defined human resource management in different ways and with different words, but the core meaning of the human resource management deals with how to manage people or employees in the organisation.edwin flippohuman resource management as “planning, organizing, directing, controlling of procurement, development, compensation, integration , maintenance and separation of human resources to the end that individual, organizational and social objectives are achieved.”the national institute of personal management(nipm) of india has defined human resources – personal management as “that part of management which is concerned with people at work and with their relationship within an enterprise. its aim is to bring together and develop into an effective organization of the men and women who make up enterprise and having regard for the well – being of the individuals and of working groups, to enable them to make their best contribution to its success”.according to decenzo and robbins, “human resource management is concerned with the people dimension” in management. since every organization is made up of people, acquiring their services, developing their skills, motivating them to higher levels of performance and ensuring that they continue to maintain their commitment to the organization is essential to achieve organsational objectives. this is true, regardless of the type of organization – government, business, education, health or social action”.evolution of human resource managementhuman resource management is evolved form the personnel management which was erstwhile management system which used to manage employees. to know evolution of personnel management one needs to see the history of centuries of research by great psychologists on human human behaviour and their response at particular situations. one among them was elton mayo who was a psychologists from the australia, did many experiments on human behaviour at different situations in 1924. he  strongly believed in work life balance for improving productivity of workers and did emphasis on human relations influence the productivity of workers and finally he has been regarded as father of human resources management.going back to roots of evolution personnel management , robert owen was regarded as creator and originator for introducing reforms for workers in his own lanark cotton mills. he created a principle of 8 hours day work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours sleep. owen identified the importance of better working conditions at workplace and its impact on the productivity and efficiency of the workers. owen after implementation of better working conditions at workplace, he observed change in the productivity of his workers as their efficiency increased. he in those  olden days implemented many social and welfare practices for his workers and saw his workers got happy, motivated and worked better. therefore he was referred as father of personnel management.it's believed that the first personnel management department (later evolved as human resource management) began at the national cash register co. in the early 1900s, according to an human resource magazine article. after several strikes and employee lockouts, ncr leader john h. patterson organized a personnel department to handle grievances, discharges, and safety, as well as training for supervisors on new laws and practices.historical milestones in hrm development >>the historical background of human resource management >>father of personnel management >>robert owenthe u.s. office of personnel management (opm) is the world's largest hr department. opm provides human resource services for the federal governments workforce of nearly 2.8 million workers.it's staff carry out the tasks to recruit, interview, and promote employees; oversee merit pay, benefits and retirement programs; and ensure that all employees and applicants are treated fairly and according to the law.what is the purpose of human resource management?the purpose of the human resource management is to make the job and deal with the job holder (employee). so as to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. in order to identify right person for a particular job, notification should be issued which contains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and specifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). so as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should be tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person. subsequently selected candidates should be provided with the proper training for performing his duties & responsibilities mentioned in the notification. later, assessment of employees' performance should be done to know whether employees are performing to the desired standards set by the management. accordingly employees should be rewarded or paid for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is the responsibility of hr manager or safety officer who should instruct safety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously followed. healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep employees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their productivity. doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy relationships between employees and management  avoids conflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation. most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and labour laws which govern all the above said activities for a job. contravenes  of employment laws will cost to the organisation and its branding. hence the human resource management is like a guardian angel for the organisation to sail smoothly and long-live.the ten "cs" of human resources management are: cost effectiveness, competitive, coherence, credibility, communication, creativity, competitive advantage, competence, change, and commitment. the ten "cs" framework was developed by alan price in his book "human resource management in a business context".why mangers must know about  human resource management?why are these concepts and techniques important to all managers? ' perhaps it's easier to answer this by listing some of the personnel mistakes you don't want to make while man­aging. for example, you don't want to:hire the wrong person for the job.experience high turnoverhave your people not doing their bestwaste time with useless interviewshave your company taken to court because of discriminatory actionshave your company cited under federal occupational safety laws for unsafe practiceshave some employees think their salaries are unfair and inequitable relative to others in the organizationallow a lack of training to undermine your department's effectivenesscommit any unfair labor practicesdifference between personnel management and human resource management.coming to the crux of difference, personnel management is the seed and root for human resources management. to say in simple words human resource management is evolved from the personnel management. main principle of the personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid to them. employees during the personnel management era were not given high priority in decision making process and weren't much allowed to interact with management. personnel management was more confined to the factories and the main focus of the personal manager was to see that everything was in compliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the morale of employees. employees were just treated as tools, obligation to the organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they were seen as  cost & expenditure to company rather than capital and investment. personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented instead of flexible and interactive with employees. nurturing  of employees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees perspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than understanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was committed by employee.human resource management see employees from the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation and they consider their employees as assets and capital for their organisation.motivating employees is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management. main principle of the human resource management is to see what should be given or provided to an employee for extracting the desired work. hr managers always encourage participation of employees in decision making and their suggestions are most valued. flexibility in work, welfare and work life balance to employees is high priority for hr managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. adoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the hr manager are well encouraged and swift. the finest difference between personnel management and human resource management is integration and augmentation of information technologies in the human resources management process and functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is money. all above artificial intelligence and roberts are taking over many hr functions ranging from employees recruitment, testing, interviewing and many more.who is

to achieve goals and objectives of the organization.establishing goals and objectives to be achieved  through the employees so as to achieve the organizational mission set by the top-level management.developing rules and procedures which has to be followed by the employees in order to avoid any sort of discrimination among the employees in any of their functions, to enable fair and transparent treatment among employees, to avoid conflict starting from recruitment to the separation of employees, inculcate discipline among the employees, to drive performance of employees and ultimately to avoid conflict and contravenes with statutes and employment laws of the land, ultimately for smooth running of the organization.determining plans and forecasting techniques as a part of human resource planning to avoid any shortfall of workforce so as to avoid impact on the output of the organisation, to draw the estimation of workforce exactly needed for the organisation and to plan for attracting talented candidates.hr outsourcing: as that of make or buy decision in operations management, human resource manager should be able to make decisions with regard to hr activities which are to be executed by the management itself or to be outsourced when there is advantage of expertise to bring in and cost-saving for organization. the following are the most outsourced hr activities;

party providers so that they can focus on their core business and also has following benefits-save money and reduce operating costsallow the company to focus on its core businessreduce the number of hr staff and related staff expensesallow hr staff to focus more on strategyavoid the costs of major investment in technologyimprove metrics/measurement2. organising- hrhr managers should be well aware of organizing everything related to human resource and organisation as organizing is the process of making and arranging everything in the proper manner in order to avoid any confusion and conflicts.giving each member a specific tasks to finish overall objectives of the job given to an employee is the duty of the human resource manager, besides it also to the duty of human resource

defeated.establishing departments and divisions according to the nature of jobs and works in order to improve the efficiency, expertise and speedup the work. establishment of separate divisions and departments would give easy and effective control over employees by the management which would give better results and improve overall performance of the organisation.delegating authority to the members for a good cause and to make employees more responsible towards their job and organisation is a part of employee development. delegating authority to employees makes them to be more responsible towards organisation as there is a principle called authority equals to responsibility, vice versa when you load an employee with responsibilities, he should be given authority so as to fulfil the responsibilities casted upon employee. authority without responsibility and responsibility without authority defeats its purpose. therefore when employees feels responsible and accepts responsibilities, it is a good sign as it makes employees to be engaged in the job.establishing channels of authority and communication is the primary responsibility of any human resource manager which would enable managers to effectively communicate desired goals and objectives of the organisation. having effective communication will avoid conflicts, make staff to understand what exactly they are expected to and also enable the manager to get the things done in time.creating a system to coordinate the works of the members so as to make the employees to work properly and not to cause any

compensation  is unjustified it amounts to exploitation of employees which is against law.setting performance standards, measuring and evaluating the employees: a performance appraisal is meant to help employees realise their strengths and shortcomings and receive a compensation accordingly. the very purpose of appraising the performance of employees is to evaluate and compensate accordingly. unless organisation sets performance standards to its employees, it cannot compare and measure employees actual performance with the standard performance. hr managers take performance gaps of employees for making decisions on employees with regard to rewarding them with bonus, profit-sharing, stock options and payment of incentives or not. these employee performance gaps will not only be considered for making decisions with regard to compensation but it is also considered for making decisions with regard to initiate corrective actions on said employees, promoting them to higher levels and if any employees performance gaps are high, such employees gets demoted, suspended or sometimes may be discharged from job.counselling the employees as a human resource manager, for understanding and helping people who have technical, personal and emotional or adjustment problems with an objective to reduce them, so that performance of employees are maintained at expected level or even improved upon.recruiting prospective employees and selecting the best ones from them is one of the primary functions of human resource management. recruiting is the process of inviting the people who

turnover cost, turnover rate, annual turnover of an employee, workers compensation cost for an employee, revenue per employee, return on investment (roi) and yield ratio.annual employee turnover rate

organisation's goals and objectives. indeed getting work done to others is an art which every human resource manager should possess, for which employee motivation by the human resource management influences and matters a lot.ensuring effective two-way communication for the exchange of information with the subordinates in order to effectively communicate the goals and objectives of the organisation as it plays key role in understanding what the human resource manager or organisation is expecting from employees to perform. miscommunication between employees block the progress and even would lead to conflicts which eventually affects the overall performance of the organisation.motivating subordinates to strive for better performance by way of providing employee recognition, rewards, intrinsic benefits, paid vacations, increments in salary, gifts, any social security benefits to employees and their family members is one of the functions of human resource management.maintaining the group morale by way of fair treatment among employees, being ethical and generous towards employees, management being loyal to its employees and giving priority to employee concerns. it is the responsibility of human resource manager to guide always to its employees, otherwise lack of guidance often kills the morale of employees. training and development programmes not

beatrice webb in their celebrated treatise on ‘history of trade unions’. collective bargaining is a method of determining the terms and conditions of employment and settling disputes arising from those terms by negotiating between the employer and the employees or their trade union. the very fact that the parties reserve the ultimate right to use economic weapons of strike and lock out helps

greatest tragedy in america is not the destruction of our natural resources, though that tragedy is great. the truly great tragedy is the destruction of our human resources by our failure to fully utilize our abilities, which means that most men and women go to their graves with their music still in them.” - oliver wendell holmes.organizational objective.to recognize that human resource management exists to contribute to organizational effectiveness. hrm is not an end in itself; it is only a means to assist the organization with its primary objectives. simply stated, the department
