## -- Feature engineering techniques --

1. N-grams 
2. Vectorization techniques: Count-Vectorization, Hash-Vectorization
3. Co-occurance matrix
4. Features extractions
5. PCA: Principal Component Alanysis.

Hash Vectorization:
    -   The count vectorization and co-occurance matrix has one limitation though.
    -   In these methods vocabulary can become very large and cause memory/computation problem.

    -   Hash Vectorization is memory efficient, instead of storing tokens as strings, the vectorizer
        apples 'Hash Trick' to encode them as numerical indexes.
    -   The downside is that, its ONE-WAY and once vectorized, the features cannot be retrived.

    -   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer   ::  scikit-lern import path.
