      "Right whale hunting has been almost entirely given up\n",
      "within the last two years. The Dundee whalers gave it up\n",
      "in 1912, because this new whaling brought down the price\n",

      "four or even five of us can squeeze at one time for meals.\n",
      "Aft of this mess-room and the foremast we have a very\n",
      "important part of our gear, a powerful winch driven by a\n",
      "donkey steam-engine. This is our reel, to wind up or let out\n",

      "But more about this winch when we tackle a whale.\n",
      "The 9th of August was a great day for us, for we started\n",
      "our 200 h.p. engines, and drove them at half-speed for an\n",
      "hour and never moved an inch, for the very good reason\n",
      "that our bows were still against the quayside. How quietly\n",
      "and simply they work. We then got our big traveller fixed\n",
      "across our deck for the sheet of our foresail. We are schooner\n",
      "rigged, foresail and mainsail both the same size, and count\n",
      "on doing eight to ten knots with engine, and six or seven with\n",
      "a fine breeze and sails alone.\n",
      "In the morning we look at our guns in the harpoon factory.\n",
      "The gun or cannon for the bow weighs about two tons. It is\n",
      "already in position; the bollard on which it pivots is part\n",
      "of the iron structure of the bows and goes right down to\n",
      "our forefoot. Its harpoons weigh one and a half hundredweight:\n",
      "we shall take twenty-five of these, and forty\n",
      "smaller harpoons for sperm or cachalot or Right whale.\n",
      "On either side of the bows there is a smaller gun pivoting\n",
      "on a bollard to fire these harpoons. These two small\n",
      "guns and our twenty-five big harpoons and forty of the\n",
      "smaller size we find arranged in order at the works—a\n",
      "charming sight to us. Harold Henriksen, the builder\n",
      "of our ship, takes us to these works, where his brother\n",
      "Ludwig and his father make the harpoons and guns that are\n",
      "now sent all over the world. The father is very greatly\n",
      "respected in Tonsberg; he is called the “Old Man Henriksen,”\n",
      "to distinguish him from the younger member of his\n",
      "family. I have already mentioned him as being co-partner\n",
      "with the famous Svend Foyn, the inventor of the new big\n",
      "harpoon for finner whales.\n",
      "He has made many inventions for marine work on all\n",
      "kinds of ships, for which he has received many medals, and\n",
      "only lately he received a decoration from the hands of his\n",
      "king, which is shown in the portrait given by him to the\n",
      "writer, a rare and highly appreciated gift.\n",
      "He is seventy-eight years old and sails his own cutter\n",
      "single-handed. I wish there were space here to tell of his\n",
      "experiences whilst working with Svend Foyn developing[30]\n",
      "the big harpoon. He takes us round the works, where forty\n",
      "years of fire and iron have made their mark; remains of\n",
      "failures are there; of burnt building and scrapped metal,\n",
      "but, besides, there are these fascinating stacks of modern\n",
      "harpoons and piles of their shell points to be used for great\n",
      "hunting in all seas.\n",
      "The “Old Man” chuckles as we wander from forge to\n",
      "forge and out amongst the geraniums in the yard as he tells\n",
      "me how the first harpoon they tried went over the walls of\n",
      "the works and landed through the umbrella of an old lady\n",
      "in the street, and stood upright between the cobblestones.\n",
      "You may believe they practised out of town after that!\n",
      "Though old—seventy-eight years to-day—he is enthusiastic\n",
      "about our new plan of whaling. He has formed a yacht\n",
      "club; everyone yachts at Tonsberg. It is on a small island\n",
      "of little plots of grass between boulders and small fir-trees.\n",
      "We were invited there to-day for the celebration of his birthday.\n",
      "There were ladies in pretty summer dresses in groups,\n",
      "cakes, teas, fruit and pleasing drinks, coffee and cigars, and\n",
      "wasps by the thousands. Norwegian ladies cultivate coolness,\n",
      "and merely brush these away as they hand us cakes\n",
      "and wine; and they would be greatly offended if a man were\n",
      "to attempt to hand tea cakes. For the carpet knight there\n",
      "is no show. I wish he could be exterminated at home. Do\n",
      "the gods not laugh when they see our menkind in frock\n",
      "coats or shooting kit handing tea and cakes to females?\n",
      "These pretty groups of summer-clad figures amongst\n",
      "lichen-covered rocks and rowans, fir-trees, oaks and honey-suckle\n",
      "were all reflected in the still water. As the sun sank\n",
      "low and a mosquito or two began to sing, fairy lamps were\n",
      "lit amongst the trees, and softly shone on groups of men and\n",
      "women in light raiment in leafy bowers. The light from the\n",
      "yellow and red lamps contrasted with the last blue of day.\n",
      "There was warm air and moths, cards and smokes, and then\n",
      "came music, and a perfect ballroom floor and blue eyes and\n",
      "light feet—a kindly welcome to the stranger in Gamle Norge.\n",
      "In the dark before dawn, with lighted Japanese lanterns,\n",
      "ladies and men threaded their way over the flat rocks to\n",
      "motor launches and bade good-bye to the hosts. I shall not[31]\n",
      "soon forget the long walk home across our island, the low\n",
      "mist, the warm, dark night, and wringing wet fields.\n",
      "There is one place in Tonsberg of which I must make a\n",
      "note before I come back to our shipbuilding. It is the\n",
      "Britannia. Anyone who wishes to learn all there is to know\n",
      "about modern whaling must get an introduction to that cosy,\n",
      "old-world club. It is a low-roofed wooden house, with low-roofed\n",
      "rooms; one big room adjoins a kitchen, in which\n",
      "broad, kindly Mrs Balkan, wife of my friend the engineer\n",
      "on the whaler Haldane, sits behind a long counter and rules\n",
      "supreme. You leave the shipyard and drop in there for middag-mad,\n",
      "or shelter if it rains. It seemed to rain very often\n",
      "in August. The “old man” Henriksen’s portrait and one\n",
      "of the great Svend Foyn are, of course, in evidence, and\n",
      "Svend Foyn’s whaling successors come there for middag-mad\n",
      "or aften-mad, and some of them drink, I dare say, a silent\n",
      "skaal of gratitude to the memory of Svend Foyn, who gave\n",
      "them the lead to success, to become small landholders, each\n",
      "with his home, farm, and family.\n",
      "Burly fellows are his successors, the pick of Norse sailor\n",
      "captains. One is just home from the South Shetlands. I saw\n",
      "these desolate, unhabitated, snow-clad islands many years\n",
      "ago, and saw there finner whales, thousands of them! and\n",
      "knew they must some day be hunted, but I did not calculate\n",
      "to a penny that there would be over a million pounds sterling\n",
      "invested in whaling stations there to-day; in one bay alone\n",
      "in Clarence Island, and that round these islands in 1911,\n",
      "twenty-two whalers would bag 3500 whales. So whaling\n",
      "here is an assured industry. In Britain the few who hear\n",
      "about it call it a speculation.\n",
      "Another ruddy-faced, broad-shouldered, fair-haired captain\n",
      "comes from South Georgia and tells me of my friend\n",
      "there, Sorrensen, the bigger of two big brothers, both great\n",
      "harpooneers—they are both quite wealthy men now. They\n",
      "whaled with us from our Shetland station a few years ago,\n",
      "and between hunts we talked of a whaling station we were\n",
      "going to start in South Georgia; two or three years at this\n",
      "station has set them up for life.\n",
      "Most of the men who come into the Britannia have been[32]\n",
      "over all the world; half-a-life’s experience of any of them\n",
      "would fill a book. But of them all I think I’d sooner have\n",
      "my friend Henriksen’s experiences. Young as he is, he has\n",
      "perhaps had more experience in whaling than any of them.\n",
      "He was whaling for the Japanese when they opened fire on\n",
      "the Russian fleet. At least he had been—he stopped when\n",
      "the guns began to fire, and took his little whaling steamer\n",
      "behind an island, and he and another Norsk whaling skipper\n",
      "climbed to the top of it and viewed the fight from shelter. I\n",
      "believe they were almost the only Europeans besides the\n",
      "Russians who saw that spectacle. Henriksen has a red\n",
      "lacquered cup—a present from the Mikado in recognition of\n",
      "his services for supplying food in shape of whale to Yusako\n",
      "during the war. In time of peace there they eat the whole\n",
      "whale, paying several dollars a kilo for best whale blubber\n",
      "and as much or little less for the meat.\n",
      "We in the Shetlands turn the fat oil into lubricants, etc., and\n",
      "the meat into guano for the fertilisation of crops. I suppose\n",
      "it comes to the same thing in the end, if “all flesh is grass.”\n",
      "So the talk, as can be imagined, wanders far afield in the\n",
      "Britannia. I heard a skipper asked by a layman what\n",
      "corners of the world he had been in, and he paused to consider\n",
      "and replied: “Well, I’ve not been in the White Sea.”\n",
      "From Arctic to Antarctic he’d sailed a keel in every salt sea\n",
      "in the world bar the White Sea and the Caspian. The telephone\n",
      "interrupts many a yarn; perhaps Jarman Jensen, our\n",
      "ship’s chandler, calls up someone about provisioning a\n",
      "station, say for three years—food, etc., for one hundred men\n",
      "for that time or longer; or perhaps there is a less important\n",
      "order from Frau Pedersen ringing up her husband from their\n",
      "little farm, telling him to call at the grocer on his way home,\n",
      "and he perhaps tells her he thinks he may not get out in time\n",
      "for dinner, and “Oh, buy a house in town, Olaus” is possibly\n",
      "the jesting answer—a great saying here in Tonsberg, where\n",

      "draw up lists of provisions for the St Ebba for a twelvemonth.\n",
      "In the rope factory run by Count Isaacksen we watched\n",
      "the last of our great whale lines being spun; three five-inch\n",
      "lines we have to port and three to starboard, one hundred\n",

      "out three times one hundred and twenty fathoms on our port\n",
      "lines, three hundred and sixty or two thousand one hundred\n",

      "a few seconds at the rate of sixty miles per hour, with\n",
      "engine going eight knots astern and brakes on, and then\n",
      "it snapped; for some big blue whales five of these lines\n",

      "you see, there is no rod used in whale-fishing.\n",
      "The rope factory and Jarman Jensen’s store are two\n",

      "pretty full of townspeople making domestic purchases,\n",
      "butter, potatoes, coffee. Jensen, with perfect calm and\n",
      "without haste, weighs out a pound of butter, wraps it in\n",
      "paper and hands it with a bow to some customer, gives a\n",
      "direction to one or two heated assistants, and comes back to\n",

      "in reply it was said to be twenty horse-power, but he thought\n",
      "eighteen of the beggars were dead! And as to speed, it had\n",
      "three—slow—damned slow—and stop! It seemed to translate\n",
      "all right—saghte—for-dumna-saghte, and, Stop! fetched\n",
      "the audience every time. At least it did so when Henriksen\n",
      "told the story, but he is a born raconteur, and infuses the\n",

      "the visitors’ children; then she will sing and play accompaniments\n",
      "on the piano, and join heartily in the general talk,\n",
      "and later will serve a parting meal and a deoch-an-doris,\n",
      "and walk a Scotch escort of a mile or two with the parting\n",
      "guest as the morning sun begins to show.\n",
      "They seem very jolly though they are so busy. Everyone\n",
      "on this island knows everyone else: they were all at\n",
      "school together, as were their parents before them. Most\n",
      "of the married people have a little farm. The wife looks\n",
      "after this when the husband is at sea-whaling. The women\n",
      "have the vote too! They voted solid a year or two ago\n",
      "for a neatly dressed, plausible young orator who came\n",
      "round the island, and when their husbands came home\n",
      "after the whaling season was over, found he was a Socialist;\n",
      "and if anyone’s interests are damaged by the Socialist in\n",
      "Norway, it is the whaler’s. So the vote for some time was\n",
      "not a favourite subject of conversation here when ladies\n",
      "were present. I think the wealthiest family in Tonsberg, a\n",
      "millionaire’s household, runs to two maidservants.\n",

      "at any other hour in the twenty-four; it is always light and\n",
      "grey. Green fields and low peaty hills lie behind grey stone\n",
      "houses, and the grey clouds hang low on the hills. The sea-water\n",
      "is grey-green. You might call the houses a sort of[56]\n",

      "white and a black steamer or two on their sea-front give relief\n",
      "to the greyness, and the white steam from their banked fires\n",
      "gives a slight sense of life and joins the grey below to the\n",

      "white feathers floating in the air—a rather Whistleresque\n",
      "picture, is it not? Another time he himself upset all his\n",

      "clear green water along the edge of the quiet town. The[61]\n",
      "water was clear as glass above white sand, and against the\n",

      "of fish, dark, velvety-green compact masses, of saith or coal-fish,\n",
      "actually as thick as fish in a barrel. These ugly dusky\n",
      "divers paid little heed to people on shore, but in regular order\n",
      "circled round the shoals, coming to within eight yards of us,\n",
      "and every now and then one would dive under the mass of\n",
      "fish and fill itself as it went, and an opening through the mass\n",
      "would show its horrid procedure as it straddled across white\n",
      "sand under the fish, till it came up with a bounce at our feet,\n",
      "shaking its bill with satisfaction and then go back to do its\n",
      "turn at rounding up, whilst another of its kind took its turn\n",
      "at eating the piltoch.\n",
      "No wonder, with this wealth of fish and fowl round the\n",
      "shore, that the Norsemen rather hanker after their old\n",
      "islands; they cure these saith and eat them through winter,\n",
      "and very good they are, and they also eat the cormorants (I\n",
      "give you my word, they are bad; I’ve eaten many kinds of\n",

      "Margaret Princess of Denmark, wife of King James III.,\n",
      "estimated at 50,000 florins, which has not yet been paid.\n",
      "So when Norway offers the equivalent, plus interest, which\n",
      "now amounts to several million pounds sterling, the islands\n",
      "may be returned to Norway. Possibly international law,\n",
      "recognising the amalgamation of the two companies, Scotland\n",

      "cabin and was fed through the skylight for a week!\n",
      "Another old whaler (I mean this time a man of thirty-five)\n",
      "I met in Lerwick. I heard he wanted to see me, for he said\n",
      "he had been a “shipmate” of mine; “shipmate” to one\n",
      "who only plays hide-and-seek with the sea sounded rather\n",
      "pleasant, so we shook hands very heartily for a few seconds,\n",
      "but we had no time for a “gam,” for I had to go about our\n",
      "business with these horrid Custom affairs. He seemed to be[63]\n",

      "have a yarn when there is more leisure.\n",
      "We have additional worry here besides the registration.\n",
      "We have to have our vessel remeasured to satisfy our Board\n",
      "of Trade. I fear it gave the registrar some trouble to come\n",
      "from Aberdeen in rough weather, and he was very sick; if\n",
      "his eye ever falls on these lines, here are my thanks and sympathy.\n",
      "If we had gone to him at Aberdeen he would have\n",

      "then he turned out to be a teetotaller and vegetarian! We\n",

      "Norway counted on breathing it again, and at every breath\n",
      "thanked heaven for its restorative energy. The morning\n",

      "outside keen air, after days buffeting on the North Atlantic\n",
      "or North Sea, to come into the warm stone house, to sit by[66]\n",
      "the glowing peats and coal, surrounded by books of travel,\n",
      "illuminated missals and natural history, to read or to listen\n",

      "and skill in picturing peoples and places at home or abroad.\n",
      "One family story he told me should be of national, or even\n",

      "in the first days of trains in this country that my host and\n",
      "his brother were coming back to school in Edinburgh from\n",
      "Cloan in Perthshire with their father. The father was considered\n",
      "a splendid traveller, for he could actually sleep in\n",
      "these Early-Victorian carriages! As he lay asleep with a red\n",
      "rug drawn over him—which Haldane says figures largely in\n",
      "his boyish recollections—he and his brother plugged cattle and\n",
      "engine-drivers and various things as they passed, or at the\n",
      "stations, with their catapults, till at Larbert old Haldane\n",
      "awakened and saw the instruments and asked the boys what\n",
      "they were. “Never had such things when I was a boy,”\n",
      "he said. They explained to him how to fit a stone into the\n",
      "leather, and he did so and held the catapult out of the window\n",
      "and let fly, and with inexpressible joy the boys watched the\n",
      "stone go hurtling into the centre of the stationmaster’s\n",
      "window. Old Haldane promptly pulled the red plaid over\n",
      "his head, and out came the wrathful stationmaster, and the\n",
      "guard, and a boy clerk, who took them to the Haldane\n",
      "carriage. Wrathfully the stationmaster pulled open the\n",
      "door, and met the gaze of the cherubic innocents. Then\n",
      "angrily he pulled the red rug aside and disclosed the stem,\n",
      "judicial features of Haldane senior.\n",
      "“How dare you, sir, disturb me in this rude manner?” he\n",
      "demanded of the guard he knew so well, and “Och, sir!\n",

      "they were taught at school that it was very wrong to fight,\n",

      "In the forenoon we fall in with three whalers from Olna\n",

      "and not one had seen a spout, and yet where we are, there\n",
      "were numerous whales only a few days ago. Like trout,\n",
      "whales seem to be unaccountably on the rise one day, and\n",
      "utterly disappear the next. So we resort to music and painting.\n",
      "Henriksen plays Grieg on the weather-worn melodeon\n",
      "and the artist paints sea studies.\n",
      "At twelve comes a meal, usually called middag-mad on a\n",
      "Norse whaler, Henriksen calls it tiffen. It is simple enough—a\n",
      "deep soup plate of hasty pudding (flour and water boiled),\n",

      "of cinnamon, on your left you have a mug of tinned\n",
      "milk and water, on your right a spoon, and you buckle to and\n",

      "awfully good; then you eat smoked raw herrings in oil\n",
      "from a large tin, black bread, margarine and coffee, such\n",
      "good coffee. I’d defy anyone to be hungry afterwards or\n",
      "ill-content. Dolphins pass us and we pick up a drifting rudder.\n",

      "the worst, as the fox said of the red dog.”\n",
      "However, I suppose we will stay out till we do find whales\n",
      "or finish coal. It almost looks as if whales could stay below\n",

      "hundred and sixty-nine since last night. “We might be\n",
      "having cream and fruit in Bergen,” he remarks; we are\n",
      "about half-way across, and we all wish we were there.[72]\n",
      "Henriksen says, by way of consolation: “Well, I was once six\n",
      "months whaling for Japs off the Korean coast, and I never saw\n",
      "a fin, and fine weather just like this”; and I tell him of our\n",

      "went bad, a grievous disappointment, for whale meat is\n",
      "worth travelling far to eat[4]; it is superior to the best beef,\n",
      "in this way, that after eating it you always feel inclined for\n",
      "more. The evening we wiled away by making an invention\n",
      "to kill mackerel, of course keeping a keen watch all the time\n",
      "for a blow. Mackerel shoals appeared in every direction in\n",
      "patches, rippling the smooth sea for miles. Our plan, inside\n",
      "the three-mile limit may sound infernal; a hundred miles out\n",
      "it didn’t seem so wicked, especially as we had keen appetites\n",
      "for fresh fish. We filled a quart bottle half full of gunpowder,\n",
      "put a cork and foot of fuse into it, slung a piece of iron under\n",
      "it, lit the fuse and dropped it into a shoal of mackerel, and\n",
      "sheered off. The result ought to have been lots of stunned\n",
      "fish. A little thread of smoke came quietly up through the\n",
      "falling sea—and then—nothing happened!—a faulty fuse, we\n",
      "supposed. We tried a dynamite cartridge and fuse later, but\n",
      "the fish had gone, and of course, it went off; and gave our\n",
      "little whaler a knock underneath as if with a hammer, then\n",
      "we hove to, and all went asleep, and the Haldane watched\n",
      "alone in the half light of the Northern night for a few hours.\n",

      "not darned. The writer’s is neither, but will be shortly, and\n",

      "roughly, a ton (2240 lb.). But the value of whale oil is\n",

      "One of the subjects that came up was that of wives at sea.\n",
      "“Ach, vifes at sea’s no good,” said Henriksen emphatically,\n",
      "and I was rather surprised, as I know Norwegian captains\n",
      "often take their wives to sea, but Henriksen has been, as a\n",

      "me dis, he vas her tird husband.” Henriksen was serving\n",
      "his time on this barque as all Norsemen do, on sailing-ships\n",
      "before the mast. At Boulogne they lay one night alongside\n",
      "the slip, and all but he had gone on shore to the cafés. He\n",
      "being youngest had to do watchman, and brewed himself\n",
      "coffee in the galley and then dozed, possibly slept for “five\n",
      "minutes or maybe two hours,” he said. “I do not know,\n",
      "and ven I vakes up I looks out and dere is a light in cabin\n",
      "so I goes quiet and looks down the skylight and der vas a\n",
      "great veemen! with luggage on de floor beside her.”\n",

      "“Who is you, vat you come here for without leave?” To\n",
      "which she replied: “I am the captain’s wife.” But the boy\n",
      "would not be bluffed. “That is not true,” he cried, “go\n",
      "away at once, you’se bad veemen, you comes here to steal,\n",
      "be off wid you before I gets the crew or the captain comes.”\n",
      "And she looked round her and rose and reached to a young\n",
      "woman’s photo on the wall and held it to Henriksen and he\n",
      "gazed and saw the truth; this elderly spacious person still\n",
      "preserved some faint resemblance to the buxom girl in the\n",
      "faded photograph. So Henriksen made his bow—you know\n",
      "how the Norse bow, straight from the hips, and apologised\n",
      "and asked forgiveness, which she very graciously extended\n",
      "to him, saying: “You very good boy, you look after ship\n",
      "well.” So he chatted away pleasantly, and got her coffee\n",
      "and food and retired again to the galley, and when he was[112]\n",
      "sound asleep again, the captain came from the town, jumped\n",
      "down on deck and came growling to the galley: “Hillo,\n",
      "you’re a nice watchman! asleep in the galley, when you\n",
      "should be on deck.” “Well, captain,” said the boy, “I\n",
      "work all day hard, and all night I vatch and den comes\n",
      "your vife and I cooks for her long times, what you\n",
      "expect?”\n",
      "“My wife,” whispered the captain anxiously. “Evan,\n",
      "here’s something for you, put that in your pocket and keep\n",
      "it, and promise not to say a word about my coming aboard.”\n",
      "Henriksen promised, and the captain turned and stole\n",
      "away along the dark quay.\n",
      "In the morning a wire came to the first mate—I think it was\n",
      "supposed to be from Antwerp—saying the captain was on his\n",
      "way home to meet his wife in Norway, on which the fond\n",
      "creature said she would at once return home to meet her good\n",
      "man, and she went. An hour later the captain appeared on\n",
      "board, and they made sail for Valparaiso.\n",
      "My wife said: “That’s a most excellent story, Captain\n",
      "Henriksen,” at which he protested solemnly: “No, no, dat\n",
      "is no story, dat is quite true, I tells you.” And we had to\n",
      "explain the differences in our language between the “story,”\n",
      "an incident, and the “story,” an untruth; if you try, you\n",
      "will find it is rather difficult to do this. The language\n",
      "question again!—how often it crops up. I wish I could\n",
      "speak Norsk properly; I have to worry along with English.\n",
      "I was told to-day I can speak that difficult language very\n",
      "well. We had all been speaking to the lighthouse service\n",
      "captain for quite a long time when he complimented Henriksen\n",
      "on his English and flatteringly told me I spoke it even\n",
      "better, and I explained I’d made a study of it for about half-a-century,\n",
      "and in fact had the honour of lisping my first words\n",
      "in his own part of the country.\n",
      "The “St. Ebba,” Motor Whaler, in Oban\n",
      "Note the whale gun and harpoon at the bow and the oil boilers amidships.\n",
      "That incident was slightly amusing: but halting English\n",
      "nearly got our Swedish motor inspector, whom we met at\n",
      "Tobermory, into serious trouble. He is such a nice-looking\n",
      "fellow, too, I felt quite sorry. He waited there for our\n",
      "arrival peacefully for three days at the Mishnish Hotel,\n",
      "putting in the time sketching. One day he made a drawing[113]\n",
      "of Aros Castle, the Allans’ mansion, and as he lay in the grass\n",
      "and ferns under the birches his thoughts went back to his\n",
      "professional work and he drew plans and symbols, and a\n",
      "native came dandering along, full of the kindly interest the\n",
      "west highlander takes in the stranger (I like it myself,\n",
      "but some people call it mere curiosity), and he ventured:\n",
      "“You will shust pe arrived, maybe by the Lochinvar?\n",

      "been reading the papers about invasions, so when he met the\n",

      "walk round the bay. It is not very far round the bay, not\n",
      "far for anyone but Tobermory natives, who are restful people.\n",
      "I once saw them watching Aros Castle on fire with their\n",

      "sketches; in the West we are very polite, for the climate is so\n",
      "mild. And as the young Swede modestly refused to exhibit,\n",
      "MacFarlane accompanied the visitor rather silently till they\n",
      "came to the famous Mishnish (famous for drams since the\n",
      "Flood), and then the young Swede began to see the humour\n",
      "of the situation, and allowed MacFarlane to examine his\n",
      "baggage, and got him at last to understand, with great difficulty,\n",
      "for he only spoke very little English, that he was waiting\n",
      "for a Diesel engine motor-whaler called the St Ebba, and\n",
      "mentioned this writer’s name, which made it all right with\n",
      "MacFarlane. And the hotelkeeper, and one or two friends[114]\n",

      "proudly passed much larger sailing craft than ourselves\n",
      "waiting in shelter for fair wind, and having hunted for a boat\n",
      "in which to deposit our pilot! We got out to sea, set sail, and\n",
      "have again become a sailing-ship with a strong breeze on our\n",
      "quarter. We knocked off eleven knots an hour, leaving\n",
      "tramps and such-like behind us. But what an awful appearance\n",
      "we have! Four days alongside the quays in Belfast,\n",
      "with coal-dust flying everywhere, have made us like a collier,\n",
      "rather hard lines, considering we make no mess coaling ourselves\n",
      "as others do. What a change there will be in the\n",
      "amenity of seaports and all towns when oil takes the place\n",
      "of coals. Imagine a clean town—Edinburgh, for example,\n",
      "and the beauty of such a dream!\n",
      "It was the air pump and the connections between our oil\n",
      "tanks that brought us into the thick of great events—into\n",
      "“Ulster Day” and the signing of the National Covenant,\n",
      "and a small matter (hunting for some flexible iron tubing)\n",
      "brought us into the great and beautiful City Hall. I am\n",
      "sure few people have heard what an exquisitely designed\n",
      "building this is—indeed, what a very handsome town Belfast\n",
      "is, taking it all round. And the people! how I wish my\n",
      "northern countrymen knew what they were like in the mass.\n",
      "How very like themselves, both men and women, but perhaps[118]\n",
      "rather bigger and stronger than the average Scot, and as\n",
      "reliable-looking, and yet perhaps a little happier than we are,\n",
      "even in their anxious times.\n",
      "I don’t think our Norse crew found Belfast altogether a bed\n",
      "of roses. Some had shore leave, with five shillings each to\n",
      "spend up town. Our cook, or steward, told me of their\n",

      "shillings to maids of Erin, fair, frail things in shawls, and the\n",
      "coy creatures fled and the three came home to the ship\n",
      "lamenting—so the watchman said. The others, to a certain\n",
      "extent, enjoyed all the tumasha, and, to be sociable, bought a\n",
      "penny Union Jack buttonhole, badges that almost everyone\n",
      "was wearing; what they signified they don’t quite know yet.\n",
      "It was jolly lucky they weren’t killed. They went up Bally\n",
      "Macarack Street, in the heart of the Roman Catholic district,\n",
      "and were mobbed by Nationalists, fifteen girls and\n",
      "a dozen men. Happily the police arrived in time. The\n",
      "tallest of our crew got a severe kick on the part he sits on,\n",
      "and the smallest got a “shock,” as he said, on his eye, and\n",
      "they say: “If we lies here in Belfast one years we no go shore\n",
      "again! No fears; dem’s folk’s mad, dem’s crazy! What’s\n",

      "we are in mid-Channel, in the north-west we have Holyhead\n",
      "Light. We forecast a run of luck for ourselves. We’ve had\n",
      "our share of head-winds and little difficulties since we left\n",
      "the south of Norway, so with the compasses we mark out\n",
      "six days’ run as long as to-day’s run, which will bring us\n",

      "But “Just about here,” the compasses pause, “I was\n",
      "three weeks,” said Henriksen. “That Christmas was the[119]\n",
      "roughest time of my life,” he continued, puffing at his new\n",

      "“We was on the Kron Prince three weeks out from Cardiff,\n",
      "seven feet water in the hold and the pumps won’t work.”\n",
      "They had reached the Azores and drifted back to the\n",
      "Bay, then to the Irish Channel, and got shelter, I think, in\n",
      "Bridgewater.\n",
      "“Captain and mate they’s on deck, with revolvers, but\n",
      "we get ashore and run away. We was not going in that\n",
      "for-dumna sink ship, I’se sure. No! tree hours at wheel was\n",

      "“With a runner—runner come alongside: we cuts square\n",
      "hole under fo’c’sle head, captain and mate, they looks all\n",
      "round deck, but not below bows, and we slips out, eight of\n",
      "us and our bags.”\n",
      "Perhaps these eight were justified for the Crown Prince\n",
      "got a new crew and sailed, and was never heard of again.\n",
      "Henriksen had three guineas sewn in the waistband of\n",
      "his trousers, and a lot of sense besides for eighteen, also his\n",
      "mate’s certificate, although he was only a sailor on board, and\n",
      "he reflected, as he went ashore, on what he knew of runners\n",
      "and their ways: how the sailor is kept by the same on the\n",
      "credit of his next two or three months’ advance wage, and\n",
      "then goes to sea with precious few clothes and say five\n",
      "shillings to land with at the next port, and has therefore to\n",
      "go to another runner until he gets another ship, and so may\n",
      "be at sea two or three years with hardly the sight of pay.\n",
      "So on getting ashore Henriksen made a clean bolt to the\n",
      "nearest railway station, jumped into first train, taking ticket\n",
      "to first station, leaving his bag with the runner, of course,\n",
      "but keeping his mate’s ticket. Where did he say he got to?\n",
      "I forget, somewhere near Liverpool, but five or ten miles he\n",
      "did free of charge as the guard was interested in his recital.\n",
      "From Liverpool he booked third class to Belfast. It was\n",
      "a wild crossing and he met, strangely enough, another runaway,\n",
      "an Englishman, and isn’t this the making of a story?\n",
      "They befriended a would-be second-class passenger and his[120]\n",
      "wife, who were obliged, by overcrowding, to go steerage, and\n",
      "both these people were helplessly sea-sick, and their poor\n",
      "children just rolled about the floor till the two young seamen\n",
      "took care of them, and held them in their arms all night.\n",
      "The father pressed a whole £1 note on Henriksen, which\n",
      "he refused, as he had plenty of his £3 remaining, but\n",
      "the Englishman was stony, and he was persuaded to take\n",
      "ten shillings, and the parents gave each of them their address.\n",
      "Afterwards Henriksen called on them—and such a fine\n",
      "house it was! Henriksen reflects now he might have called\n",
      "on these old friends in Belfast this journey. “They must\n",
      "be old people now. Next time I come to Belfast,” he says,\n",
      "“I calls—maybe they’s in life.”\n",
      "At Belfast he went on a local tramp, then got berth as\n",
      "second mate, and had twelve months at sea without a day\n",
      "ashore. For it was to Bahia that he went, where you anchor\n",
      "almost out of sight of land. For I forget how many weeks\n",
      "he lay at anchor, then sailed to another port, twelve men\n",
      "in the fo’c’sle, seven with monkeys, the rest with parrots,\n",
      "fancy the racket! then to Mobile Bay and then back to\n",
      "Troon, “two houses and a wall,” as he describes our charming\n",
      "little Scottish seaport, then home to Norway. That is\n",
      "all you sometimes see of foreign parts if you go down to\n",
      "the sea in ships. Nine months at sea with one night ashore\n",
      "is the writer’s longest spell of salt water, but Henriksen\n",
      "tells me he knows of a man being twenty-seven months at\n",
      "sea without getting on shore. I think I must make a\n",
      "special book of Henriksen’s adventures. As told to me\n",
      "they are interesting, but our surroundings count for a good\n",
      "deal: over a chart in the little lamplit cabin or on our\n",
      "quarter-deck (three steps and overboard), the moon overhead,\n",
      "and our sails looking dark and large, and our Æolian\n",
      "engine singing its steadfast song.\n",
      "Though only a little south of Ireland, we have the real\n",
      "swell of deep sea; rolling low hills that leave no level horizon\n",
      "to us, for we are so close to the sea-surface, long, gentle undulations\n",
      "that suggest a perfect golf-course for elderly people.\n",
      "We have a steady air from the north-east like the Trades.\n",
      "Possibly we may never have to shift a sail till we reach[121]\n",
      "the Azores, and certainly to-day there was that in the light\n",
      "at midday, the sharp shadows on faces as we took the sun’s\n",
      "altitude, that, even with a pigeon-grey sky, reminded me of\n",
      "southern light that I have not seen or felt for several years,\n",
      "and we did things with our coats off, and brought our rifles\n",
      "on deck for an overhaul.\n",
      "Our Norwegian heavy bores for sea-elephants cost £3,\n",
      "and as far as I can see are extremely accurate at the\n",
      "short range. I have tried them at one hundred and one\n",
      "hundred and thirty yards and they do not burst. It will\n",
      "be interesting to compare the effect of my higher velocity\n",
      "sporting mauser, a 375, with their work. Possibly the\n",
      "larger bullet of the Norse rifle, about 500, may be more\n",
      "useful for this huge animal at close range. The Norsemen\n",
      "are sure of this, but I back the bullet with the higher\n",
      "velocity every time.\n",
      "There is a gale this evening and we are running with\n",

      "his knowledge, so “Muckle gale and pass ower,” we say, and\n",

      "Ireland, and now have somewhere about two thousand fathoms\n",

      "a trysail ready for the aftermast. It was very black and\n",
      "awesome, but we managed to hold on our course. It is\n",
      "rather risky heaving round head to wind after you have run\n",
      "till the sea is dangerous. If you do not put down the wheel\n",
      "at the right moment you have a chance of getting one of\n",
      "these black seas and their huge white crests full on your[123]\n",
      "beam or bridge and perhaps becoming a wreck in a second.\n",
      "It was as if the lights of cities at night showed every instant\n",
      "round the low horizon every now and then, to be blotted out\n",

      "round-topped iron door! But once inside there is peace\n",
      "and warmth and lamplight and steamy air from the cooking\n",

      "dinner, for it’s too rough for cooking more than tea. Then\n",
      "out into the black, wet, slippery deck again. Phew! How\n",
      "it blows, and how difficult it is to see now! Then to the\n",
      "bridge again and the St Ebba beneath us, a patch of black\n",
      "with two lights like eyes shining aft from the galley, a mass\n",
      "of dark against the wicked white of the surf which we tear\n",
      "in the dark sea—a black cat on a white bearskin, in a half-lit\n",
      "room. I suggest to the styrman (Norse for first mate)\n",

      "Anyway I must pretend that I like it too.\n",
      "A chunk of green sea came over our poop and bridge last\n",
      "night, banged on our iron cabin door which faces astern\n",
      "with a thunderous shock and swept over the bows. Some\n",
      "went over the bridge, and a lot came down to the cabin,\n",
      "enough to be unpleasant. Out came styrman like a rabbit\n",
      "from his bunk, and I’m pretty sure both the writer and\n",
      "captain’s colour was not suggestive of pure joy. In a brace\n",
      "of shakes, after this big wave broke over us last night,\n",
      "Henriksen was at the wheel and the engine going again—the\n",
      "engineer had stopped it for some reason, perhaps to let\n",
      "our decks clear off the sea. Then sacks with waste and oil\n",
      "were rigged out on either bow, and we continued, the seas\n",
      "breaking angrily but out of reach of us. So we drove through[124]\n",
      "the night and are satisfied, and won’t do it again. We did\n",

      "a harpoon into the dolphins. They appeared again at night.\n",
      "The sea was full of phosphorus, so we could see their brilliant\n",
      "tracks shooting round backwards and forwards like the\n",
      "trail of rockets. Though I have been amongst hundreds of[125]\n",
      "whales at different times and seasons I have never had the\n",
      "luck to see one going through a phosphorescent sea; but\n",
      "Henriksen tells me a year or two ago, off Korea, he tried to\n",
      "harpoon one in the dark, aiming at the glare as it passed\n",
      "alongside. He could scarcely see the gun and fired a bit\n",
      "too far back, I think at the light, instead of ahead of it, and\n",
      "missed and saw the yellow blaze of light under water as the\n",

      "that whale went fast,” he said.\n",
      "It is Sunday, the 8th October, an idyllic Sunday; there’s\n",
      "a grand, blue, rippling swell, and enough air to keep our sails\n",
      "spread, so we roll gently along, a block creaking occasionally\n",
      "and our little engine throbbing beautifully. But there is\n",
      "a slight feeling of annoyance aft, and it’s easily understood.\n",
      "Our skipper has his idea of what Sunday at sea should be\n",
      "when there’s no whaling or hard sailing to attend to, and\n",
      "I agree with him. He thinks all clothes-washing and drying\n",
      "blankets and mattresses should be done on Saturday, Sunday\n",
      "should show clear decks, shaved chins and, if possible, a change\n",
      "of clothes and mind. But most of our crew apparently have\n",
      "been brought up to the common idea of Sunday as washing-day\n",
      "and have hung up shirts and clothes of all kinds everywhere.\n",
      "Henriksen endures the un-Sundaylike display but\n",
      "vows “never again.” Next Sunday we will be neat and\n",
      "clear, or all hands will be working double tide at flensing or\n",
      "hunting whales—we shall see!\n",
      "Meantime we have had days of quiet ship work, the sea\n",
      "getting more blue each day, and winter clothes shedding.\n",
      "On this account we held a shoppie on Friday—got out the\n",
      "captain’s slop chest from the hold. This is an old sailing-ship\n",
      "custom. Six of us carried it aft to quarter-deck, unlocked\n",
      "it and took all the contents into the little cabin, and\n",
      "wasn’t it a well-stocked shop—jerseys, trousers, boots in\n",
      "cardboard boxes, caps, shirts, woollen gloves for the cold\n",
      "northern seas, and white and blue dungaree suits for\n",
      "tropics, and scented soap! It was new for me to see scented\n",
      "soap on such a business. Henriksen and the first mate\n",
      "have a busy afternoon with their coats off and pipes going,\n",
      "looking up prices and calculating the ten per cent. profit—a[126]\n",
      "small profit to cover risks—and good articles. I’ve seen\n",
      "fifty per cent. made off very inferior goods. And the crew\n",
      "come down one by one and buy what they need or can\n",
      "afford, and “ask me” if the atmosphere doesn’t get thick\n",
      "towards lamplight time.\n",
      "There was not much sale in the way of winter kit. The\n",
      "heaps of mits and thick woollen socks will not be appreciated\n",
      "till St Ebba gets far south towards the ice edge.\n",
      "With our present crew of Norsemen it is not so easy to get\n",
      "interested in them, individually, as with sailors of our own\n",
      "race; still the few words we have of each other’s language,\n",
      "eked out with signs and drawings, go far—drawings especially;\n",
      "indeed, from the captain downwards, painting excites\n",
      "far more intelligent interest among our crowd than they\n",
      "would with my own countrymen. Our old Dundonian\n",
      "whalers were neither very musical nor artistic. Here the\n",
      "skipper plays Grieg, and has a lively interest in every æsthetic\n",
      "aspect and every change of form and colour in waves and\n",
      "sky, and has actually taken up water-colours and playing on\n",
      "my bagpipe practice chanter, but I fear that for neither of\n",
      "these will he be able to spare time, for a skipper is, or should\n",
      "be, practically on duty all the time. But his first attempt at\n",
      "water-colours—a blue sea and white breakers under a blue\n",
      "sky—was not half bad. The blue sea was there all right, but\n",
      "the rhythm of the waves and the half tints, who can do them\n",
      "justice?—Wyllie, to a certain extent, but I cannot remember\n",

      "It is a real day of rest, contemplation and dreaming.\n",
      "Our greatest effort has been to rig a line for dolphins. Both\n",
      "the trolling tackles we had out were carried away last night,\n",
      "so I unearthed a tunny hook I had fastened to a wire rope\n",
      "with a strip of aluminium to act as spoon bait. Now that is\n",
      "trolling astern for the benefit of any wandering albicore,\n",
      "tunny, bonita dolphin or such-like. I expect the crack of\n",

      "showing between them and the sea. Most of them have their\n",

      "is rather a pretty bit we are coming to”—and I looked, and\n",
      "my breath almost went with the unexpected beauty. The\n",
      "dock or basin we swung into in our boat is built of black\n",
      "stone whitewashed to the water’s edge, with two flights of\n",
      "steps for people to land by. It is only about ninety yards\n",

      "windows and adjoining houses of pale pink and yellow tints.\n",
      "In the deep shadows of the alcoves and in the sun on the[133]\n",
      "steps there were figures, men, women, and boys, mostly\n",
      "resting, some in brilliant colours, some in sombre tints;\n",
      "and these and white boats at their moorings were reflected\n",
      "in the waving dark ripples of the basin. For an artist I\n",
      "would say this hundred yards of light and shade and colour\n",
      "is worth all Venice.\n",

      "of Kirkcudbright to Spain, and westwards, till you come\n",
      "to the Saragossa Sea—a quality in the atmosphere that\n",
      "makes the night here redundant with colour and the day\n",
      "superlative.\n",
      "Why do you not see quite such soft richness of colour in\n",
      "the air farther east? There is greater velvetyness of colour\n",
      "here in the Azores than in Madeira, or the west of Spain,\n",
      "or anywhere in the Mediterranean, or the Far East.\n",
      "I could sit here for weeks, day and night, watching the\n",
      "changing effects, the queer parrot-coloured weathered boats,\n",
      "with their furled-up white cotton sails coming alongside the\n",
      "steps; the steps are greenish black volcanic stone, whitewashed,\n",
      "and the stone shows here and there, and the white\n",
      "is of infinite variety of tints and the sunlight is so soft and\n",
      "mellow that patches of colour, say a man’s pink shirt, or a\n",

      "The boats that come in from the blue are vivid in colouring,\n",
      "brilliant emerald, yellow, and scarlet, with thick white cotton\n",
      "sails. The largest are three-masted feluccas, long and\n",
      "narrow, with sails like swallows’ wings. Each has a crew\n",
      "of at least eleven men and boys, with brown faces and black\n",
      "hair and beards. They go bare-footed, and wear a peaked\n",
      "pointed knitted cap exactly the same as we have in the Fair\n",
      "Isle off Shetland; and each figure is a joy for ever of sun-bitten,\n",
      "faded-coloured garments of many colours. Then\n",
      "think of these figures in the blue night moving noiselessly\n",
      "with bare feet, unloading short yellow planks for pineapple\n",
      "boxes in half electric, half moonlight, the velvety shadows[134]\n",
      "of the tropics and all the vivid colours of the day still distinct,\n",
      "but softened down to a mothlike texture, and the blue tiles on\n",
      "the house above the arches glittering in the moon’s rays.\n",
      "If you add to these sensations of colour, and the perfect\n",
      "stillness, the scent of pinewood planks and the perfume of\n",

      "intoxication.\n",
      "Both the people of Ponta Delgada and the town itself\n",

      "shillings per day, with extremely good feeding—beef from oxen\n",
      "on the hills fed on wild geraniums, heath, and hydrangeas,\n",
      "and fish of many kinds.\n",
      "I tried my trammel net for fish alongside in the bay. I\n",
      "set it with the second mate’s help; it is forty fathoms\n",
      "in length, and by midday\n",
      "there was quite a\n",
      "good catch of many-coloured\n",

      "those exquisite silvery\n",
      "fish, about the size and\n",
      "shape of a saucer, that\n",

      "The trammel net\n",
      "is quite new here, and\n",
      "is new to my Norwegian\n",
      "companions and to the\n",
      "natives. I find it of much\n",
      "use on our Berwickshire\n",
      "coast for supplying the house with fish. It consists of a wall,\n",
      "as it were, of fine net hung between two nets of very large\n",
      "mesh; with corks on top and leads below. It can be set either\n",
      "standing on the bottom or hanging from the surface—the\n",
      "fish swim against it, make a bag of the fine net through a\n",
      "mesh of either of the big nets, and in this pocket they stay\n",
      "till you overhaul your net, possibly once a day.\n",
      "Here we found a worm like one leg of a star-fish made such\n",
      "havoc with our captive fish in the net that we had to overhaul\n",
      "it every four hours or so. On the second evening I\n",
      "got three splendid fish, like salmon, of about six pounds each,[135]\n",
      "with large silvery scales and small heads—cavallas, I hear\n",
      "them called.\n",
      "Whatever their name may be, of one thing I am certain,\n",
      "they make splendid eating, and taste like small mahseer—of\n",
      "course everyone knows their taste!\n",
      "I rigged up a bamboo rod, using cast of Loch Leven\n",
      "flies, with the wings cut off, with small pieces of sardine for\n",
      "bait. We made\n",
      "quite good baskets\n",
      "of young bonita,\n",
      "and tunny, and\n",
      "sardines: tunny fry,\n",
      "of course; a two-year-old\n",

      "time. You can even take them on a tarpon line if you\n",
      "think life is too long.\n",
      "A thing I could not understand about this small-game\n",
      "hunting was the way certain silvery fish eluded our efforts\n",
      "to catch them. Whilst other fish ate the finely chopped\n",
      "sardine meat we threw over, and young mackerel and\n",
      "herring, etc., calmly took our hooks baited with pieces of\n",
      "sardine, these flat silvery fish like saucers on edge almost at\n",
      "once grasped our idea—they eyed the bait and hook, sailed\n",
      "along the gut of the dropper, examining it closely, sailed up\n",
      "the gut of the cast and said: “No, no, we will take bait without\n",
      "a hook, but not this.” I wonder why their perception\n",
      "should be so much keener than those of the other fish; probably\n",
      "none of them had ever seen a hook in their lives.\n",
      "But this writing about small fry is “wandering from the\n",
      "point,” as the cook said to the eel; let us get back to whaling\n",
      "or at least to whale-hunting.\n",
      "We are off to the west end of San Miguel to go round it and\n",
      "beat about the north side in search of the whales which\n",
      "everyone tells us are to be found there, and the view of glens\n",

      "waited for the Consul about some affairs at Robert’s Café,\n",
      "a large, quiet café, with wide-open doors facing the sea. As\n",
      "we sat there rather silently, away in the velvety blue night,\n",
      "out to sea beyond the breakwater, several rockets rose and\n",
      "burst in a golden shower and we heard the continuous blast of\n",
      "a ship’s horn making signals of distress. We jumped! so\n",
      "did the other two or three cigarette-smoking habitués of the\n",

      "of the crisp rolls and real butter and vino tinto! And\n",
      "as I rested and made furtive notes of the patron there\n",
      "came music from above or some room near—a piano of early\n",

      "air of one of Moore’s melodies.\n",
      "It is used in Indian as a bearer’s tune, and these are what\n",
      "I can recall of the words from the long ago. It’s a sweet air\n",

      "expect the light wind to take us down to some shallower\n",
      "soundings which we see on the chart several miles south and\n",
      "east of San Miguel, where we hope to find whales; for they\n",
      "are in the habit of frequenting the edges of “banks,” when\n",
      "say two or three hundred fathoms change into a thousand\n",
      "fathoms.\n",
      "The way of a man with a maid is perhaps a simple problem\n",
      "compared to the ways of whales. Who can tell how they\n",
      "guide their course, year after year, past the same points,\n",
      "travelling, for instance, off the Shetlands always N.E. along,\n",
      "you may say, a definite line.\n",
      "Our plan for next week or so is to beat up the seas north\n",
      "of San Miguel, going about twelve miles, spying six miles\n",
      "on either side, then taking a right-angle course for other\n",
      "twelve or twenty-four miles, and so spying a large tract of\n",
      "sea, and by this simple means we can keep our position\n",
      "easily; and we keep the ordinary four hours’ watch; later,\n",
      "when we get whales, “if” I should say, we will have all[143]\n",
      "hands on deck all day, and only a watchman on deck at night\n",
      "to attend to the steam cookers—but when will that be?\n",
      "There is a new moon to-night and I turned some silver\n",
      "leiras and a sixpence in my pocket, and will play the pipes—they\n",

      "hot—wind westerly and we paddle away east from San Miguel.\n",
      "The island is getting low now on the horizon, but we still see\n",
      "a glimpse of sun on its highest land beneath the shadow of\n",
      "the great cloud cap—a glimpse of fields and faint white\n",
      "specks for cottages. Yes, my first impression seems still\n",
      "to hold—a land you could live and love in, with such exquisite\n",
      "sunny soothing fresh air; from the little glimpse\n",
      "we had of its people such ideas seem tenable.\n",
      "We drifted all night, with riding light, taking things easy.\n",

      "well, we have other islands to discover and circumnavigate.\n",
      "“Discover” is the word I want. Once, long ago, the writer,\n",

      "rigging. The turtle was a browny yellow patch near the\n",
      "surface of the deep blue sea. We turned back to try and\n",
      "harpoon it, but it had gone down.\n",
      "Though there is little life to see in ocean to-day it is\n",

      "under our bows, and nearly give us a chance of putting in a\n",

      "without drawing on what I think it might be like, or faking,\n",
      "to use the artist’s term. But they kept so much under\n",

      "sure enough, without the least warning, the wind had gone\n",
      "right round to north-east and was rapidly rising, driving\n",
      "us towards these beautiful villages and cliffs and bay and\n",

      "It seems to me that a higher, quicker sea rises in these\n",
      "warm latitudes than in the colder northern or southern high\n",

      "quite probable destruction.\n",
      "By six-thirty A.M. we were past the light on the west end of\n",
      "San Miguel, at least we believed we were—it was not visible;\n",
      "being at an elevation of three hundred feet, it was, of course,\n",
      "obscured by the low clouds; it is no use putting lighthouses[148]\n",
      "very high, as witness Sumburgh Head, south of Shetland;\n",
      "I have been within two miles of it in clear water, and it was\n",
      "invisible in the clouds above, and we only heard its bray!\n",
      "Then our guiding angel, to play with us, stopped our engine.\n",
      "But in spite of her, we got it to go again, and crept into the\n",
      "lee of San Miguel, on one or two groggy cylinders, and\n",
      "rolled about in the downpour of rain, and the poor engineers\n",
      "are now sweating again to get even one cylinder to take us\n",
      "back to Delgada, where we will have an overhaul; and\n",
      "Henriksen and I, poring over our sodden chart and the well-washed\n",
      "cabin amongst sea-boots and oilskins cast aside this\n",
      "morning, decide that the weather of the Azores is not suited\n",
      "for whaling at this time of the year. If there were harbours\n",
      "or bays or lochs such as we have in Shetland we would stick\n",
      "here, but long, black nights to windward of islands, with\n",
      "strong gales starting from anywhere, and only one day in\n",
      "five smooth enough for even our St Ebba to whale in, “is\n",
      "not good enough.”\n",
      "Now the engine is going; bravo, stick to it! Very, very\n",
      "slowly and gingerly—with three cylinders—we crawl away\n",
      "with a fearful roll to Delgada again.\n",
      "But the day fades before we get opposite Ponta Delgada,\n",
      "a yellow sunset and rain clouds and cumuli to west, the pin-point\n",
      "of light on W. of the island beginning to show, and\n",
      "another pin-point on Delgada about ten miles to windward,\n",
      "so we stop engines, hoist foresail, and drift, rolling very\n",
      "gently and quietly, waiting for dawn, and the local pilot’s\n",
      "awakening; we could go into the breakwater ourselves, but\n",
      "his services are compulsory.\n",
      "All is very quiet and peaceful to-night, and no references\n",
      "are made to last night. Sailors have nerves as well as other\n",
      "folk, and I daresay all on board will take a day or two to\n",
      "recover from the excitement and drenching, and the bitter,\n",
      "nauseating feeling of being up against one’s end on a storm-beaten\n",
      "coast in black night. I have a curious feeling that\n",
      "even writing about such a recent and painful situation is\n",
      "almost indelicate. To put in time Henriksen draws on his\n",
      "recollection of killers or grampuses attacking a whale, and I\n",
      "help it with what I have seen of a similar incident. He saw[149]\n",
      "this particular incident off Korea; I have seen several whales\n",
      "being attacked both in northern and southern latitudes\n",
      "amongst the Antarctic ice; in fact, I once could have jumped\n",
      "on to the back of one as it rose right under our stern and gave\n",
      "a huge blast or sigh, with a pack of these black-and-white\n",
      "marauders surrounding it!\n",
      "That was a night in the Antarctic worth recalling. It was\n",
      "a still day, far inside the pack ice. I remember being lost in\n",
      "admiration of the quiet blue lanes of water, blue and violet,\n",
      "and the many pearl-like tints of the ice, and as I looked\n",
      "northerly I was astonished to see penguins jumping on to\n",
      "the floe ice in a great hurry, down the sides of one of these\n",
      "long lanes. Penguins do not show themselves in the water,\n",
      "they suddenly leap out like trout and disappear. In this\n",
      "case they remained on the ice-floes, skedaddling to their\n",
      "centres in an agitated manner. Then the cause of the\n",
      "emeute appeared—there were hurried blasts from two whales\n",
      "coming down the lane towards us, and behind them the\n",
      "splashing of a pack of black-and-white killers. On they\n",
      "came, the penguins popping on to the ice edges, jumping two\n",
      "or three feet clear of water, and I had time to get into our\n",
      "mizen rigging and get a fine view of the first whale, a hundred\n",
      "feet long, as he sailed under our keel. The next one[150]\n",
      "rose to blow immediately under our counter, and anyone\n",
      "standing at our wheel could have jumped on its back.\n",
      "I did not see the end of the chase. I expect the whales\n",
      "were making a flight into tightly packed ice, under which\n",
      "they could possibly go to greater distance than the killers\n",
      "without breathing—at least that is our explanation of their\n",
      "manœuvre.\n",
      "These, of course, were finner whales, we were hunting for\n",
      "Right whales, the difference between the two in shape, etc.,\n",
      "I have referred to at the beginning of this book.\n",

      "insteps—and see Portuguese doctor, you go bare-footed\n",
      "on such boats as ours in sub-tropics, and this was\n",
      "the result.\n",
      "I met the captain of our wreck, the B—enido, a Welshman,\n",
      "in a tight place, and almost as silent on shore as on his\n",
      "ship, but I felt sorry for him.\n",
      "The engines were thoroughly overhauled, and favourable\n",
      "was the verdict of the engineers on them—which was satisfactory\n",
      "for all hands; the first engineer, a Swede, would like\n",
      "to take three hundred shares in our Company if he could\n",
      "get them. He is so confident about our engine, possibly he\n",
      "may more correctly be described as sanguine.\n",
      "We entertained British Consul Rumble to dinner, a return\n",
      "compliment for several courtesies from him, to-night at\n",
      "eight P.M., and he is just departing; my feet are very sore.\n",
      "We caught about fifteen good fish in the trammel-net, and a[151]\n",
      "lot of sardines in a fine bag-net which I bought here for the\n",
      "ship; it is spread from an iron ring and catches a few of the\n",
      "more foolish fish; we also caught a ray, or skate, yesterday,\n",
      "about eight feet in width, in the trammel-net. Some people\n",
      "would venture to eat it, we did not, it was so black and ugly.\n",
      "Our engineers and officers have worked very hard all week,\n",
      "overhauling the engine, taking it all to pieces, reassembling\n",
      "it, and working till one o’clock each night. So we promised\n",
      "them a jaunt on shore to the Seven Cities, the wonder of\n",
      "the island.\n",
      "So this Sunday morning I saw six of our crew off for\n",
      "a drive over the island, the captain on the box, a burly\n",
      "figure compared to the little Portuguese driver beside him,\n",
      "two engineers, two mates, and the steward, all in neat\n",
      "Sunday dress, inside an open antediluvian barouche held\n",
      "together with string, the springs down on the axles, and a\n",
      "huge heap of ragged maize tied behind to feed the scarecrow\n",
      "horses. I was to have gone with them but there was not\n",
      "room, and I found it impossible to get more than the one\n",

      "or had gone off with Sunday parties. To get the one, I’d\n",

      "and listen to infinite reasons for there being no possibility\n",
      "of getting a trap at all.\n",
      "But it was worth the trouble of hunting for the carriage\n",
      "to see my six good shipmates drive off in great form with a\n",
      "crack of the whip, rumbling over the cobbles, and waving\n",
      "hats to the writer, who suddenly felt somewhat lonely.\n",
      "But to-day, Monday, there’s nothing to keep me on board,\n",
      "I have done my painful duty; I have drawn in best style\n",
      "our registered number on our sails above reef points, according\n",
      "to act, and on tin plates for stencils to paint the same\n",
      "on St Ebba’s side to port and starboard.\n",
      "On our fore quarter, there is now L H, which signifies\n",
      "Leith, and 256, each letter the thickness—number of inches\n",
      "and fraction of an inch—ordered by the Board of Trade, with\n",
      "the distance between letters and figures all according to the\n",
      "law of the Medes and Persians.\n",
      "It went decidedly against the grain to stamp our yacht-like[152]\n",
      "craft with such vulgar herring-fisher’s symbols. And\n",
      "putting black paint by mistake on a white sail is enough to\n",
      "make a yachtsman weep. What benefit can be derived by\n",

      "So to-day I also must go and see these Seven Cities.\n",
      "No one knows the reason for the name; my messmates tell\n",

      "at the bottom, and round the lakes are smaller extinct\n",
      "volcanoes covered with foliage.\n",
      "Arming ourselves, therefore, with a sandwich of goodly\n",
      "proportions, and a bottle of vino tinto from our friend Sancho\n",
      "at the Atlantico café, we sallied forth in solitary state in an\n",
      "old brougham, one artist whaler, three horses and a Portuguese\n",
      "driver, and a bundle of maize straws astern, and drove\n",
      "and drove, always uphill, through little whitewashed villages\n",
      "and narrow lanes, between low stone walls, and crops of\n",
      "Indian corn, rather dry-looking, with pumpkins and gourds\n",
      "on the stubbles; past many farm carts, loaded with golden\n",
      "maize or pumpkins, and with groaning, squeaking wooden\n",
      "discs for wheels, till high up we came to little grass fields and\n",
      "hedges of bramble, and loose stone dykes with bracken and\n",
      "canes on them, and where the air was fresh as in Perthshire,\n",
      "and there were very wide views of the blue Atlantic. The\n",
      "drive felt long, but a sketch-book going, helped to make the\n",
      "road feel tolerable, but it was quite an hour and a half before[153]\n",
      "we came to our change place, Lomba da Cruze, and mounted\n",
      "a stirrupless pack-saddle on a donkey, and began an hour’s\n",
      "uphill climb through cuttings of lava deposit, overhung\n",
      "with brambles, many laurels, heath and ferns.\n",
      "Killers Attacking a Finner Whale\n",
      "Possibly this stylo sketch in sketch-book may be a sufficient\n",
      "description of the Seven Cities. Imagine two green absinth-coloured\n",
      "lakes, green foliage, and a few white houses at the\n",
      "bottom of a crater; with this sketch you have the scene, and\n",
      "you can fancy the charm of the fresh, keen air up the mountains\n",
      "combined with Sancho’s great ham sandwich and tinto,\n",
      "but heaven fend the reader from the pain of a wooden saddle\n",
      "on a donkey riding down such a hill again.\n",
      "The road home was wearisome to a degree, hundreds of\n",
      "local squires or farmers, and everyone lifting hats, but why?\n",
      "Who knows? The effort to respond was quite ridiculous.\n",
      "Someone should invent an automatic hat-lifter for royalties,\n",
      "Norwegians, and natives of the Azores. Groups of women\n",
      "were on either side of the road shelling yellow maize, sitting\n",
      "like Indians; and at last and at length we got into Delgada,\n",
      "having had more than enough of cultivated maize lanes\n",
      "and lava dykes.\n",
      "Then to Portuguese shipping agents and to business\n",
      "accounts, not a pleasing part of whaling. It is difficult to\n",
      "settle our affairs, on leaving port. For instance, the harbour\n",
      "trustees, or whatever they are called here, wanted to charge\n",
      "for the morning’s incoming pilotage after we had gone out to\n",
      "save a wreck, but we barred that. “You old mens sleeps\n",
      "here ashore,” said Henriksen. “We’s go out, slips anchor—dark\n",

      "been Titanic and we save thousands’ lives. You say you\n",
      "haves many tow-boats! why nones go out? What about\n",
      "insurance, heh?” They quietly dropped the subject.\n",
      "But now it’s time to go and put aside the above reflections\n",
      "and disappointments so far; we have hope, and months,\n",
      "possibly years, and certainly long seas in front of us, to gain\n",
      "or to lose in.\n",
      "So we up anchor at night with a light air from the east,\n",
      "and several weeks’ sailing in front of us to Madeira and Cape\n",

      "capital—pale pink and blue—show in this early sunlight.\n",
      "Your great clock on the white campanile marks six A.M.\n",
      "and the sunlight glitters already on the blue tiles above the\n",

      "who would paint in highest toned water-colours—flowers,\n",
      "fruit, wine skins, white walls, and blue sea. I will grant you\n",
      "all this, San Miguel, but there’s a grim side to your island—cliffs\n",
      "and a lee-shore on a black night, and I seem to recall\n",
      "a wreck and rockets, distress signals all a fraud, and then\n",
      "there are those moonlike craters, your beauty spots. You\n",
      "and the Inferno, Saint Michael, seem to be somewhat neighbourly.\n",
      "And your people we recall, how kind to the stranger,\n",
      "a few of them, dark-haired girls in white dresses on green\n",
      "balconies seemed pretty enough, but in the country how\n",
      "close they seem to the soil, worn and aged, one good-looking\n",

      "No, we do not drop tears at leaving you; but think hopefully\n",
      "of Madeira and Funchal to the S.E., where we may\n",
      "meet white people of our own race, and where I have seen\n",
      "whales; and perhaps we may have a day or two in the\n",

      "departures—that hurried one in the night watches to save\n",
      "a wreck was quite satisfying, so “we” doze and let the[155]\n",
      "town and the island go by, and think of Madeira and the\n",
      "Cape Verde, and hope that some day soon our little expedition\n",
      "will begin to pay, and try to forget that so far we have\n",
      "only incurred expenses—five shillings here and five pounds\n",
      "there—pilotage and telegrams, and a thousand trifles that\n",
      "mount up alarmingly without one penny of return.\n",
      "Thus musing somewhat sadly, and all the time listening to\n",
      "the beat of our engines, I notice they suddenly go a little\n",
      "slow, and a tide of depression that even the joy of leaving\n",
      "port will not quite raise, floods my spirits. Yes, they are\n",
      "dead slow now—something wrong again!—and I harden my\n",
      "heart and turn out and find we are heading back for the\n",
      "distant island—more weeks of detention, I can see. But—what\n",

      "craned necks!\n",
      "Great Scott! There are whales—Sperm—as you live!\n",
      "At last—whales! One little blast on the calm grey ocean\n",
      "a mile away, then another, eight or nine. Nine times\n",
      "several hundred pounds sterling rolling round, each about\n",
      "a mile apart. Are we really in our senses—are we really to\n",
      "strike oil? Heaven be praised—it is not the engine—it is\n",
      "all right.\n",
      "We’re after one.\n",
      "Henriksen made a bee-line down to his cabin, got out powder\n",
      "and had the harpoon-gun loaded and ready in two shakes.\n",
      "It is difficult to write about the day now, we are tired,\n",
      "the work has been great and our first whale worth, say, some\n",
      "hundred pounds, enough to cover our outward-bound expenses;\n",
      "it seems hardly believable.\n",
      "It is true we have only one of these sperm. We could, I\n",
      "believe, have killed several, but for a completely new crew[10]\n",
      "at whaling; we thought one would be enough for us. It is\n",
      "a bit awkward with one fish running a line, to tackle a\n",
      "second that perhaps goes in the opposite direction, and the\n",
      "flensing at sea for such a small crew is such a big work that\n",
      "we simply stuck to the one.\n",
      "[156]\n",
      "We chased it for hours; there is no good in chasing one\n",
      "and then rushing off to the next that appears; by a fluke\n",
      "you might strike across the stranger’s course and get him on\n",
      "the rise, but the best plan is to study the movements of the\n",
      "whale of your choice, and by judiciously following it learn\n",
      "its movements so as to cut across its course and get in your\n",
      "harpoon at the right time.\n",
      "It is difficult to describe the intense excitement of chasing\n",
      "whales, and the more so when your interest in it is even\n",
      "more than the hunting—when you have shares to make\n",
      "profit on, for friends interested in the bag.\n",
      "At about seven-thirty we saw the whales, and by nine we\n",
      "had been three times almost within harpooning distance, say\n",
      "within forty yards, when always the whale “tailed up,” and\n",
      "took his final dive. A whale comes to the surface, blows\n",
      "and takes in breath, several times, just going below surface\n",
      "between each blast. After it feels refreshed it goes below\n",
      "on its business for a dive of, say, twenty minutes or half-an-hour,\n",
      "and may appear any distance from the spot it went\n",
      "down at. In this last dive it raises the after part of its body\n",
      "with a slow elevation, a sort of sad farewell to the hunter.\n",
      "Certain whales, such as the sperm and narwhal, and Right\n",
      "whales, lift the whole tail out, but others, such as the finners\n",
      "we hunt off Shetland, only show the ridge in front of the tail;\n",
      "and seldom show their tails or flukes until they are harpooned.\n",
      "One thing that comforted us greatly was that we knew\n",
      "from this whale’s movements that though he avoided our\n",
      "treading on his heels, as it were, he was never scared or\n",
      "gallied by our engine or propeller’s beat.\n",
      "It would take volumes to describe the different ways of\n",
      "each kind of whale. The sperm whale usually feeds in\n",
      "something of a circle, so you keep cruising round the inside\n",
      "of the circle.\n",
      "For hours we chased, very seldom speaking, eating brown\n",
      "bread, and drinking coffee, standing on deck, sticking to\n",
      "the neighbourhood of our first acquaintance, balancing the\n",
      "prospects of our expedition’s failure or success on the way\n",
      "this one whale took our approach. Sceptics had told us\n",
      "the beat of our motor would frighten a whale more than[157]\n",

      "The actual firing and hitting a whale any good pistol-shot\n",
      "can do. But manœuvring the vessel, stalking the\n",
      "whale, as it were, needs a good deal of experience, and it\n",

      "Another of our crew, “Bow,” we will call him, rigged\n",
      "a longer hand-line and fished deep, and soon pulled up\n",
      "some magnificent spotted mackerel. This bait-catching was\n",
      "apparently the object of the early morning start—large[170]\n",
      "mackerel for bait for the tunny, and small fish to catch the\n",
      "mackerel. The small fish, when they are let loose, are supposed\n",
      "to hug the shadow of the boat and so keep the tunny\n",
      "in the neighbourhood: besides this purpose, they form our\n",
      "principal food at midday.\n",
      "These large mackerel were kept alive alongside on tethers,\n",
      "hooked by the nose—with a rather clever rustic swivel on\n",
      "the line—kept alive to be used for the tunny. But usually\n",
      "a big basket is kept floating alongside, into which are put\n",

      "fifteen plies, each with thick iron hook at its end.\n",
      "After we had caught enough mackerel we went several\n",
      "miles farther out to sea, and the two men in the stern each\n",
      "made fast a large mackerel to his line—put the big iron hook\n",
      "through its nose and a fine wire twisted lightly, from the\n",
      "shank to the neck of the barb to prevent the fish working\n",
      "off.\n",
      "Finally we had four of these live baits and strong lines at\n",
      "different depths, drifting astern; and two men at the oar\n",
      "gently paddled to keep the boat in position and the lines\n",
      "up and down. For hours we sat so, and thought tunny-fishing\n",
      "uncommonly dull.\n",
      "If one could speak Portuguese it would help to pass the\n",
      "time. What fun it would have been to get the local “clash”\n",
      "from these pleasant-looking men, all in tatters, miraculously\n",
      "stitched together. How curious would have been their\n",
      "views of life and their experiences and traditions, but my\n",
      "interpreter was sick as could be, and made neither moan\n",
      "nor attempt at translation, so the crew chatted and better\n",
      "chatted between themselves, and laughed occasionally, and\n",
      "so passed the time, whilst the writer patiently and silently\n",
      "held a line for hours, waiting for the huge tug that seemed\n",
      "never going to come.\n",
      "But the next boat to us soon got one—a whacking big\n",
      "fellow; he fought them for an hour and a half and they gave[171]\n",
      "him twenty strokes of a bludgeon on the head in a smother\n",
      "of foam alongside the boat, and pulled him over the side with\n",
      "two huge gaffs and ropes, and then sat down exhausted. He\n",
      "was about two-thirds of the length of the boat and must\n",
      "have weighed well over three hundred pounds, and was\n",
      "worth £3 at the market, to the two men and two boys\n",
      "who got it. Lucky fellows! They lifted the boat seats to\n",
      "show it to us, and there it lay, a silver and blue torpedo-shaped\n",
      "fish with huge deep shoulders. The natives call the\n",
      "tunny albicore. We congratulated them and gazed at it,\n",
      "and listened to their gasping description of the fight, how\n",
      "it had sounded seven times and taken out a desperate\n",
      "number of lines. Then other two boats lost one each—that\n",
      "is, they got into fish that were too big for them, and made their\n",
      "lines fast, and the fish broke away. Time was their consideration;\n",
      "they prefer several smaller fish of, say, one or\n",
      "two hundred pounds to a bigger one that may weigh five\n",
      "hundred pounds but will take the whole day to play it.\n",
      "It got tiresome as the hours went by with never a soul\n",
      "to speak to, for “41” and the interpreter were both still ill,\n",
      "and the sun got very hot, so we decided that after midday\n",
      "meal we would up stick and make sail. A flat hearth of\n",
      "charred wood was laid amidships. Three small boulders\n",
      "were laid on it and sticks between, and these were lit and a\n",
      "great tin can of sea-water was set on the stones to boil, with\n",
      "the fish, and sweet potatoes, in it, and a right hearty meal\n",
      "we made, with fingers for knives, and the blue Atlantic for[172]\n",
      "a finger-bowl, and the appetising meal was washed down\n",
      "with water from a barrel and some ruby red vino pasto\n",
      "wine fit for the gods.... Ah, well, better luck next time,\n",
      "we were saying, as we were about to haul in our line, when\n",
      "the tug came, a most tremendous tug!\n",
      "We are fast in a tunny at last! and a pulley-haul fight\n",
      "begins—what a weight it is! You feel as if you were pulling\n",
      "up the bottom of the ocean for a second, and then that it is\n",
      "pulling you, willy-nilly, into its depths, therefore you let go\n",
      "line, and jam it down on the gunwale to check it, and it runs,\n",
      "squeaking, out, cutting a groove in the wood. I cannot tell\n",
      "you how much stout line went out—there were many lines\n",
      "the thickness of flag halyards of thirty fathoms each, attached\n",
      "to each other—but the whole stern of the boat seemed filled\n",
      "with wet coiled-down line when we had been pulling in for\n",
      "a few minutes, and then, in a minute, it was almost gone,\n",
      "and then wearisomely two of us pulled it in again, hand over\n",
      "hand, with much gasping and tugging, more and more line\n",
      "is coiled up in our stern sheet, but still no sign of the fish.\n",
      "As the fight—pull devil, pull baker—proceeded another man\n",
      "managed to pull in the other lines all in a heap, and we were\n",
      "able to devote our united attention to the fish. It seemed\n",
      "strong as a horse and took us practically all in charge, and we\n",
      "had to be nimble to let the whizzing loops of hard line get\n",
      "away clear of our feet and wrists. We were pretty well\n",
      "blown, cut and sore, by the time its efforts lessened. Then\n",
      "we got in coil after coil, six coils in hand then lost two, then\n",
      "eight and lost one, then set teeth and pulled steadily with\n",
      "both hands between times, and at last and at length, the\n",
      "silver glitter we expected showed deep down in the blue.\n",
      "Even then there were many more coils to bring in; the water\n",
      "being so intensely clear, the enormous mackerel showed many\n",
      "fathoms down, swinging round and round.... The latter\n",
      "part of the fray needed instantaneous photography to depict\n",
      "it—what with the tunny pulling and our weight all leaning\n",
      "to one side to get the line in, and then to gaff the fish, and the\n",
      "roll of the sea combined, too many things happened at one\n",
      "time to be very clearly remembered afterwards. We had\n",
      "two gaffs—huge affairs—and as the tunny dashed here[173]\n",
      "and there we managed to get one into it, then the second,\n",
      "and we lurched half-seas over; the tunny was kicking up a\n",
      "smother of foam all the colours of the rainbow! Then with\n",
      "the gaffs we pulled its head out of the water up to the gunwale,\n",
      "and banged it twenty times with a wooden thing like\n",
      "an Indian club till it was still, or only quivered, then a\n",
      "lurch from a blue sea seemed to help to get half of it on\n",
      "board, and a big heave and it all came in, and we lifted a\n",
      "seat and put it along the bottom and raised ourselves and\n",
      "waved our hats. It was quite as good fun as any salmon-fishing\n",
      "I have ever had, and nearly as exciting as whaling;\n",
      "that is, during the actual playing, but the previous waiting\n",
      "was trying beyond words, you get roasted by the sun and\n",
      "bitten by salt spray and stiff and cramped—you “chuck\n",
      "and chance it,” and chuck but once in half-a-day and may\n",
      "have to wait days and days before you catch your first\n",
      "tunny.\n",
      "Getting all the lines clear again took a long time and neat\n",
      "and patient handling; we did not help at that, we were\n",
      "rather tired. But we watched the iridescent colours of\n",
      "the tunny fade; in half-an-hour its brightest blues and\n",
      "shimmering pinks and silver were almost gone, and\n",
      "changed to dark green on the back and dull silver below.\n",
      "Fifty-four kilos we made it out to be—five feet three\n",
      "inches long, with enormous girth. Unfortunately I lost\n",
      "its chest measurement, but think it was four feet three\n",
      "inches. The three-hundred-pound tunny we saw caught\n",
      "close to us was worth £3 at the present market\n",
      "value.\n",
      "At four we gave up. The everlasting rolling in hot sun\n",
      "on tossing sea, however beautifully blue, as you lie drifting,\n",
      "becomes very trying in a small boat; besides, the native\n",
      "fishermen themselves all knock off between three and four.\n",
      "But we must try again, and some day, when we thoroughly\n",
      "know the ropes, we will get a small sailing craft and try the\n",
      "business single-handed, for there is a lot of fun, in my opinion,\n",
      "to be had fishing so, for trout or salmon—to play your own\n",
      "salmon and gaff it, or manage your boat and trout and land\n",
      "it, say a five-pounder on fine tackle, is excellent, but to land[174]\n",
      "a tunny single-handed, doing your own sailing and gaffing,\n",
      "would be—just sublime!\n",
      "It was pleasant sailing back to land close-hauled with the\n",
      "fresh breeze, which had risen with the sun and turned the\n",
      "smooth swell into crisp waves with blue breaking tops, that\n",
      "soft and white breaking sea of the Trades that is more caressing\n",
      "than threatening. Most of the other boats gave up fishing\n",
      "at the same time, about three P.M. The skipper gave me the\n",
      "tiller; neither of us could speak the other’s tongue, but there\n",
      "is a quick understanding between all of us who sail small\n",
      "boats, and both skipper and boat seemed to become old\n",
      "friends to me. They are better sailing craft than I had\n",
      "fancied, though they do not draw much, for they have to be\n",
      "beached; but they have two bilge keels, which make them\n",
      "sail pretty close—they all sail closer and are “lighter in the\n",
      "mouth” than I had expected. You notice in the drawing\n",
      "they have a high stem and stern post, and the rudder ships\n",
      "just as it does in the boats of the north of Norway. The sail\n",
      "is simple, a large square dipping lug—the canvas from Dundee—the\n",
      "tack is made fast at the stem, or a little to either side,\n",
      "and the sheet is simply rove through a hole in the gunwale\n",
      "of the sharp stern.\n",
      "We got ashore at last and “41” and the Juan Fernado,\n",

      "smoother water.\n",
      "We climbed up the cliffs in the late afternoon and “41”\n",
      "had to explain to José, the major-domo of the hotel, why we\n",

      "which we know are there, but, owing to the last\n",
      "two vessels that called there having been wrecked, insurance\n",
      "rates became prohibitive; so we acted on the alternative\n",
      "plan we had formed in Norway, and went to the Seychelles\n",
      "to find if my old whaling chart said sooth about the sperm\n",
      "there. I had also heard from old whalers that there were\n",
      "many blue whales, and these we knew had never been\n",
      "hunted, and the sperm we counted on having increased\n",
      "in numbers; since the sperm-whaling was almost given up\n",
      "forty years ago. Our forecast was correct; we found both\n",

      "only much oil, owing to the warmth of the water, but also the\n",
      "use of the bodies of the whales. One of these drifted ashore\n",
      "beneath Government House. It was very high, and we were\n",

      "them in the last two days. Why, there is one now,” and they\n",
      "pointed to a piece of ice about seventy feet high, and about\n",
      "two hundred feet in length. Bruce was silent. I remember\n",
      "one of the first considerable bergs we saw in the South was\n",
      "over two hundred feet in height and more than nine miles\n",
      "long—we only saw one end of it! He had not quite realised\n",

      "and bits of bluish ice—one of us spotted a black speck away\n",
      "down to leeward and the first watch bolted for their rifles\n",
      "and we steamed down. Pop—pop—went the rifles, the\n",
      "mausers at about fifty yards. A lucky shot drew “first\n",
      "blood”—a small one-year-old hooded-seal. Great was the\n",
      "rejoicing in our little community, and we forgot the cold and\n",
      "dreary aspect, and dropped a boat and the seal was aboard\n",
      "and flinched in no time.\n",
      "Then the writer turned in for one, also Archie, and the\n",
      "señors made merry with a tiny drop of whisky and soda,\n",
      "and were very well pleased. In my dreams I heard another[188]\n",
      "shot and the engine stopped, and we crunched up against\n",
      "ice, so I knew another seal had gone to the happy hunting\n",
      "grounds; I showed a leg for half-a-minute, not more, it was\n",
      "shivering cold on deck.\n",
      "Young Don Luis Velasquez had got the seal through\n",

      "On this almost mild morning of pigeon-grey sky, light and\n",
      "fine rain (8th July), we are passing through a wilderness of\n",
      "ice pans and small floes and the soft grey sky is reflected\n",
      "on the rippling lavender-coloured sea. The ice pans are\n",
      "mostly blue and white, like blue muslin overlaid with white,\n",
      "which shows almost emerald-green under the water. On\n",
      "the pans are fresh-water pools reflecting soft grey of sky,\n",

      "And on some of the floes are seals lying at rest, whilst others\n",
      "disport themselves as dolphins do in the sea, but we stop\n",
      "not for these, for the lavender sky is deep in colour away\n",
      "ahead, so we know there is more or less open water free of\n",
      "ice, possibly leaving a road for us to Greenland’s ice-bound\n",
      "strand. That is our object, slightly uncertain of\n",
      "attainment, as it depends on the drift of the polar ice from\n",
      "the North. In some years you can make the land easily—other\n",
      "years it is unattainable.\n",
      "We keep a sharp look-out from the crow’s nest and bridge\n",

      "Here we may meet a large male polar bear, for they venture\n",
      "far afield. Nearer land we are likely to fall in with family\n",
      "parties, females and cubs. Where the seals are, there are\n",
      "the bears. It is a very curious thing about seals of the\n",
      "Antarctic sea as compared with these Arctic seals, that you\n",
      "very seldom see them in the South showing their heads above[189]\n",
      "water; either they are under water or entirely out and up\n",
      "on the ice. I have seen many thousands there, and only\n",
      "remember seeing about a dozen heads above water in several\n",
      "months. And here again, or round our coasts, seals constantly\n",
      "show their heads above water. Another odd difference\n",
      "is that in the Southern Polar ice-seals make for the\n",
      "middle of the ice-sheet if they feel any alarm. They expect\n",
      "no harm to come to them on the ice. In fact, you can go up\n",
      "to them and touch them. Here they waddle off as fast as their\n",
      "flippers and caterpillar-like movements will take them, and\n",
      "get into the water for security, the reason being, that in the\n",
      "North they have bears and men and land animals to contend\n",
      "with, and neither man, bear, nor any other land animal\n",
      "exists down South. There the enemy is in the sea, the orca\n",
      "gladiator, the grampus killer, which has most awful jaws\n",

      "round; and at supper we ate it, some of us did—I did not—at\n",
      "least only the tiniest morsel. It began to feel rather dull,\n",
      "so I suggested to Gisbert we should get the foils out and we\n",
      "would fence on deck in the falling snow, and Archie would\n",
      "photograph us and we would send the result to “Lescrime,”\n",
      "and we were just buttoning up our leather jackets for the\n",
      "fray, when young Don Luis Velasquez put his glass up\n",
      "at our cabin door and spotted a bear on a small floe not\n",
      "three hundred yards away, eating seal. We thought it was\n",
      "probably the sealskin and blubber of my morning’s seal,\n",
      "which we had let go adrift, owing to the sores the bear’s\n",
      "claws had left on it, making it dangerous for the hands\n",
      "engaged to skin it. Pusey finger we called the wounds in\n",
      "the Antarctic which we got from cutting up seals that had\n",
      "been torn by a grampus. Though colds are rare in Arctic\n",
      "regions, and consumption is said not to exist, yet often sores[210]\n",
      "take long to heal; cuts on the hands, for example, often take\n",
      "a long time to grow fresh skin.\n",
      "So our quiet Sabbath evening became all excitement, and\n",
      "we dived for rifle, pistol, and lasso; the lasso because we\n",
      "could see the bear was not full grown, possibly a three-year-old,\n",
      "and we hoped we might get it alive. As we raced down—four\n",
      "oars in the whale-boat—I endeavoured to get some of\n",
      "the frozen stiffness out of the rope and got it into coils in the\n",
      "bow, and before I had completely done so, we were down\n",
      "wind and near the bear. It stared at us and made rather a\n",
      "sudden and alarming approach to the floe-edge, as if it intended\n",
      "to come on board. I expected to lasso it on the ice,\n",
      "but it plunged into the sea and came up within ten yards.\n",
      "At the first throw the loop dropped neatly round its head\n",
      "and sank a little, and a hard pull and a turn round the\n",
      "bollard or timber-head in the bow made the bear fast.\n",
      "Cheers from the men and roars from the bear, and Gisbert’s\n",
      "congratulations; he was surprised at such a cast from\n",
      "his pupil. (But he was not half so surprised as I was.)\n",
      "It was very pretty as it stood looking at our approach in the\n",
      "boat, faint yellow, darker than snow; two black tashes for\n",
      "eyes, one for nose and two dark marks for ears, and the red\n",
      "of the seal’s flesh and skin on the snow—very simple colours,\n",
      "very delicate pale emerald-green and blue on the ice. When\n",
      "it came running at us it was too picturesque! We towed it\n",
      "alongside the ship, gnashing its teeth and roaring, where it\n",
      "swam about, expressing its disgust, in language I dare not\n",
      "quote, at the rope round its neck and its inability to tow the\n",
      "ship away. It may be too big and strong for us to manage\n",
      "on board—probably measures eight feet from nose to heel\n",
      "and is three to four years old; six-month cubs are what we\n",
      "can handle more easily, and even at that age they are wonderfully\n",
      "strong. Gisbert told me he lassoed a cub, and was\n",
      "throwing an extra hitch round its forearm, when it got\n",
      "alongside him, put one hand on his chest, and he went down\n",
      "like grass, and he is short and very strong, and is quite\n",
      "fourteen stone; he got his arm rather badly bitten. All\n",
      "hands set to work to make another strong timber cage, and\n",
      "they had it done almost before I had made a picture of the[211]\n",
      "bear as it looked at us approaching in the boat, and long\n",
      "before Ursus showed any fatigue from swimming and roaring.\n",
      "Then there was wild work in the boat getting the strop\n",
      "round its waist—oaths and foam, and flying ropes—donkey-engine—roars\n",
      "from the bear—shouts from the men—steam,\n",
      "and bear’s hot breath, all mixed up. But out it came, only\n",
      "as strong perhaps as two or three wild horses, and we managed\n",
      "to drop it into the top of the cage, hauling its head down\n",
      "with the lasso rove through the bottom bars of the cage, and\n",
      "banged down battens on top, with great eight-inch nails\n",
      "driven in, by six or seven strong Vikings, Gisbert leading\n",
      "and having all they could do. Then we cut the lasso and\n",
      "he was free of the loop in a second or two. So we have two\n",
      "live bears now, possibly polar cousins. The first is to port,\n",
      "the second to starboard of main-hatch, and their deep voices\n",
      "give a strong accompaniment to our progression. They\n",
      "have no qualms about eating; they tear the timber of their\n",
      "cage and eat seal’s fat from our hand alternately.\n",
      "It is my early watch to-day, three A.M. to nine A.M., till\n",
      "welcome coffee-time. There is nothing doing, no whale’s spout\n",
      "and no bears appear. Still one never knows, so Olaus paces\n",
      "the foredeck with his hands deep in his pockets and Larsen\n",
      "works away quietly at the bear meat, taking off every bit of\n",
      "the fat, so that it will be good for our table. I write in our\n",
      "little chart-room on the bridge, with a view all round of floes\n",
      "of ice extending right round the horizon; we are anchored\n",
      "to one—in its shelter. The wind is falling and it is very\n",
      "quiet; there is the lap, lap of the small waves against the\n",
      "green edge of the floe, the tweet, tweet of some ivory gulls,\n",
      "and the homely barn-door-fowl-like cluck, cluck of the\n",
      "fulmar petrels, as they squabble and splutter under the\n",
      "stern for scraps of food, not forgetting the frequent low, deep\n",
      "growls of the bear we lassoed last night. His companion,\n",
      "our first capture, is asleep, possibly dreaming that it is free,\n",
      "poor fellow! So I study my immediate surroundings without\n",
      "interruption. A flight of ivory gulls has just come and\n",
      "has lit beside us on the floe. They are white as this paper\n",
      "and yet not quite so white as snow; they have dark beaks\n",
      "and feet and black eyes, so what you see when they stand in[212]\n",
      "order on the pinkish white snow is a series of almost invisibly\n",
      "yellowish white upright sort of sea-birds, which you would\n",
      "not notice at all, but for their dark legs and eyes and bills.\n",
      "If there happens to be one of the pale blue ice ponds just\n",
      "beyond them, then you see them white against it distinctly,\n",
      "and the blue is reflected under their bodies as they stand\n",
      "beside the pool, or when they rise and flit over it it shines\n",
      "under their wings. They always stand bills up wind, as if\n",
      "they had come from somewhere and expected something,\n",
      "but are not particularly anxious about it. They do not\n",
      "seem to be excited about the flesh we throw into the snow\n",
      "at this early hour; later they all start to eat it at once.\n",
      "The fulmars seem to eat all the time. These yellowish\n",
      "white birds with chalky-grey and brown wings are always\n",
      "with us, round our stern, battling ever about scraps of seals’\n",
      "blubber; there is quite a homely farm-door sound about\n",
      "their cluck, cluck. Seamen say they are reincarnated souls\n",
      "of men lost at sea—rather a far-fetched idea, to my mind.\n",
      "Then there comes a Richardson’s skua. We need a specimen\n",
      "for Edinburgh Museum, so I drop it on the floe with no\n",
      "compunction; it is the sea-birds’ pirate and has a touch\n",
      "of the cuckoo’s plumage under its wings. It neither reaps\n",
      "nor sows, simply lives by cheek. When a simple fulmar has\n",

      "reaches the water!\n",
      "Though our ice-scape is very remote and far afield, and\n",
      "subdued in sound and in colour, there is a great deal going\n",
      "on. At the floe-edge there are reddish shrimps in the clear\n",
      "cold water, and if you take some of the water in a glass, you\n",
      "will see still more minute crustaceans, a joy of delicate\n",
      "coloured armour under the microscope. And there is inorganic\n",
      "life amongst the ice; a blue block has just come sweeping\n",
      "past very slowly—it is like blue and white muslin. But\n",
      "big life, bar our three selves on deck this morning, there\n",
      "seems to be none. All the rest of our crowd are sound asleep[213]\n",
      "below decks. I think they should be up and doing, for the\n",

      "On first seeing an ivory gull you are not greatly impressed;\n",
      "it is simply an entirely white gull. But you recall Arctic\n",
      "travellers mentioning it, and the little pause they make after\n",
      "its name; and when you see them yourself you realise what\n",
      "that means ... that little creamy white body that reflects\n",
      "the grey of the sea under its wing, or the blue in the pool on\n",
      "ice-floes, its inconsequent floating white flight is the very\n",
      "soul of the Arctic. As closely associated with the ice-edge\n",
      "there is another white bird in the Antarctic, the snowy\n",
      "petrel, a delicate white spirit bird, a never-to-be-forgotten\n",
      "touch of white delicacy in the almost awful beauty of the\n",
      "Antarctic floe-edge, a small bird, white and soft as a snow-flake,\n",
      "flitting amongst white and Doric ruins on the edge of\n",
      "a lonely sea. Here the white counterpart is a larger, a more\n",
      "material creature on the edge of a shallower, less impressive\n",
      "ice-pack, but the kinship is there.\n",
      "How I wish it was breakfast-time! two more hours before\n",
      "our “much too strong she-cook” will give us frokost.\n",
      "At this point in these meditations we came across another\n",
      "bear; we had let go our floe and were heading north-west,\n",
      "the day clearing (bump! that was ice), when we spotted him\n",
      "on a small floe, across which he sped at a good speed. At first\n",
      "we thought it was small enough to take with lasso and keep\n",
      "alive, so we chased it, but it proved on close acquaintance\n",
      "to be an old she-bear, and far too big and strong to rope,\n",
      "so we dispatched it with my 38 Colt pistol with one\n",
      "shot in the centre of its white head at ten yards, which\n",
      "killed it stone dead, much to the astonishment of crew, who[214]\n",
      "had no idea of what a pistol can do. Not an hour later, still\n",
      "before the longed-for breakfast, we spotted a big bear on a\n",
      "floe to windward, just five minutes after our watch was up,\n",
      "so it came in the watch of Don Luis Velasquez, who came\n",
      "on at nine o’clock.\n",
      "It was fascinating, watching the great beast with the\n",
      "glass as it sauntered to and fro on the floe, a seal lay on the\n",
      "floe not far out of the line from windward, and we fondly\n",
      "hoped to see the bear stalk it, but before it quite crossed the\n",
      "line of scent, and when not a hundred yards from the seal,\n",
      "he evidently thought he would like forty winks, so he\n",
      "shovelled himself a lair in the snow and turned in, but it\n",
      "was not quite to his liking, so he got up and looked towards\n",
      "us, and either did not see our rigging or did not mind it and\n",
      "lay down again, so that we only saw his great yellowish\n",
      "back above a snow ridge. So Gisbert and Don Luis had\n",
      "time for a tiny whisky-and-soda, but no breakfast, and set\n",
      "out with a large camp-following, and we others went on\n",
      "with coffee and bear-steak, and at our leisure went to the\n",
      "bridge and watched their long walk over snow ridges and\n",
      "wreaths and blue-water pools. The ice-bear looked up\n",
      "when they were about two hundred yards distant and began\n",
      "to come towards them, then thought there were too many,\n",
      "and retired. He was pretty well peppered by both rifles\n",
      "before he gave in, fifteen to twenty-five shots we heard—the\n",
      "account varies, but he was hit several times. When you are\n",
      "by yourself, or with only another man, the bear will face you\n",
      "and come to the attack, so you get a better chance than when\n",
      "it is inclined to retire, as it did in this case. This was another\n",
      "male of large size. I made a jotting of him before he yawned\n",
      "and lay down to sleep, he probably had breakfasted—at\n",
      "least he did not notice the seal distant from him about\n",
      "twenty yards.\n",
      "There is much bumping to-day—floes are heavy and close\n",
      "and we have to charge some which makes the splinters fly\n",
      "from our sheathing of hard wood. It seems more hopeless\n",
      "than ever to reach the North Greenland coast. The floes are\n",
      "so large and numerous, we fear that even did we do so, a little\n",
      "easterly wind might hem us in on the coast against land ice,[215]\n",
      "where we might have to stay indefinitely. Still, two days may\n",
      "alter the aspect of ice entirely: Svendsen details all this to\n",
      "us with the stump of a pencil on the white wood of our new\n",
      "captive’s cage to which he puts his black nose and ivory\n",
      "teeth and crushes splinters, now and then using his claws.\n",
      "He must know us all now, but they naturally are not very\n",
      "friendly yet and the deep, musical vibration of their growls\n",
      "coming right aft from the waist, sound sometimes a little\n",
      "like curses “not loud but deep.” We can stand that, but\n",
      "when the note changes to something like “For the Lord’s\n",
      "sake let me out,” to freedom and the wide floe, we have to\n",
      "harden our hearts and think of little children at home.\n",
      "At lunch we talk bear and other sport and Arctic cachés.\n",
      "The last a subject that is fascinating. The first I ever heard\n",
      "of was from one of Leigh Smith’s men of the Eira. We\n",
      "were in the tropics, he was steering when he spoke of it,\n",
      "with longing. He had wintered with Leigh Smith in Franz\n",
      "Josef Land before that part became popular, and as he\n",
      "steered he told me how, before leaving for their forty days’\n",
      "voyage in an open boat to Norway (they had lost their ship\n",
      "in an ice squeeze), they buried the spare rifles, musical\n",
      "instruments, and champagne. How one’s teeth watered as\n",
      "we heard of these “beakers, cooled a long age in the deep\n",
      "delved” snow, and little did my companion Bruce or I ever\n",
      "think we would be near that caché; but five years later\n",
      "Bruce was up there, and found the rifles, musical-boxes and\n",
      "champagne bottles were there, just as described, but alas\n",
      "the bottles were burst! Gisbert tells me he also saw\n",
      "the same caché ten years later, and he knows of a finer\n",
      "one still, still untouched by the A⸺ Z⸺ expedition.\n",
      "It is also in Franz Josef Land—a cave in rock, blasted out,\n",
      "and covered with a timber door so thick that not all the\n",
      "polar bears in the Arctic, good carpenters as they are, could\n",
      "open it. That is the Duke d’Abruzzi’s caché, and there are\n",
      "others; one, I think, on Shannon Island, which we aim at\n",
      "getting to and which we will add to, if not in need of provisions,\n",
      "and draw on if we are in distress. The idea is to\n",
      "add to such a store if you can, for the benefit of anyone really\n",
      "in need. It is a wicked thing, however, to draw on a caché,[216]\n",
      "excepting in case of being in want of the necessaries for\n",
      "existence. I have had one pilfered in the barrens of Newfoundland\n",
      "of tea and sugar, raisins, chocolate and such\n",
      "luxuries, the necessaries, flour and hard tack, being left untouched.\n",
      "Were the man found who did this, his life would be\n",
      "made a burden to him through the breadth of Newfoundland.\n",
      "But to come back to our ice-bears. I have lately, and at\n",
      "other times, heard many stories about them, and the more\n",
      "I see of them the more do I believe about their strength, and\n",
      "timidity, their fierce courage, and docility. One bear does\n",
      "one thing, the next the opposite. One dies with two or three\n",
      "bullets whilst running away, the next eats them up, advancing\n",
      "to the attack.\n",
      "Gisbert’s closest contact, bar the occasion before mentioned\n",
      "with the young bear, was quite exciting and unexpected.\n",
      "He left the ship one day to verify the height of a mountain\n",
      "in Franz Josef Land, which he had previously calculated\n",
      "from sea—went up a steep ice-fall with ski in tow and got\n",
      "to near the top, when a fierce gale, with snow, started.\n",
      "Following the bear’s plan, he looked for a hole to slip into,\n",
      "found such a shelter, and crawled in. By the faint blue light\n",
      "coming through the ice roof and sides of the cave he discovered\n",
      "a great bear, with its black nose resting on its folded\n",
      "paws and its dark eyes looking at him with a kindly expression.\n",
      "He did not trust the expression, but, keeping his\n",
      "eyes steadily on the bear’s, he gently pulled his rifle forward,\n",
      "and without lifting it, with his thumb pushed back the\n",
      "safety bolt, and slowly brought forward the muzzle to the\n",
      "bear’s ear and pulled, and so Gisbert lived to tell the tale.\n",
      "It sounds a moderately tall story, but after many others\n",
      "I have heard, and even from what I have seen lately, it does\n",
      "not sound so wonderful as it may to one who has not been at\n",
      "“this end of the garden.” When the gale blew over, some\n",
      "of the crew came up to his signal, and three all told, slid\n",
      "down the slope on the white bear’s body, at the foot it was,\n",
      "of course, deprived of its skin; when you think of it, the\n",
      "whole proceeding seems rather hard on the bear.\n",

      "five minutes some of us were out at the cabin door to look\n",
      "at the view. Only a plain of snow fading in violet ridges\n",
      "into the mist, with very few features, but the delicacy of\n",
      "the colour you hardly notice at first, day after day grows\n",
      "on you, and if you try to paint it, it grows more quickly,\n",
      "and you realise the difficulty of trying to reproduce Nature’s\n",
      "highest quiet notes. It was our watch till three—that is,\n",
      "Archie’s and mine—but the others stayed up, though there\n",
      "was little chance of seeing a bear. So inside the cabin we\n",
      "piled coal on to the small stove and blew smokes, and it was\n",
      "warm, distinctly cosy, and the guitar thrummed, and several\n",
      "of us hummed and wrote and smoked, and then went out\n",
      "into the cold, frosty air and looked at the colour, the fantasy\n",
      "of ice form and colour and the icicles hanging from scanty\n",
      "rigging, and came back to the cabin and vainly tried to find\n",
      "words to express appreciation of the beauty of the white\n",
      "scenery.\n",
      "So we stayed up till the end of our watch, then Archie and\n",
      "I turned in, very sleepy, and our Spanish friends stood their\n",
      "watch as well, till nine. They never seem to turn a hair\n",
      "for want of sleep.\n",
      "[219]\n",
      "On the 15th of July we started looking for\n",
      "whale or bear in the mist again, but with\n",
      "never a sign of either. So painting was\n",
      "the order of the day for the writer, such\n",
      "a chance, no letters, no newspapers,\n",
      "nothing to take one’s mind off looking\n",
      "at the effects of this end of the garden.\n",
      "Hours flew, middag mad of bear passed,\n",
      "painting still going, only interrupted\n",
      "by expeditions forward, where our men were packing the\n",
      "bear and seal skins in salt in barrels. Later we went\n",
      "ashore—i.e. on to the blue floe—blue ice covered with\n",
      "white crystals, you might call it snow. Three of our party\n",
      "and the dog, a young Gordon setter, wild with joy at freedom\n",
      "of movement, they go off a mile or so over hard, smooth\n",
      "surface, which grows more and more faint in the sunny haze\n",
      "and distance. The surface on this particular floe was smooth\n",
      "and hard and easy to walk on. In most places you see the\n",
      "light coming up as through a carpet of white crystals on pale\n",
      "blue glass beneath your feet. Where there is a little water\n",
      "it is quite blue, and where it is dry you shovel your feet\n",
      "through loose white crystals on the top of the blue. So this\n",
      "is rather different from Antarctic floes, which, as far as I\n",
      "can remember, were covered with fresh snow, so the walking\n",
      "was generally more difficult than here. Before I had seen\n",
      "northern floes my Dundee whaler companions used to tell\n",
      "me how they often played football matches on the northern\n",
      "ice, and I wondered!—now I understand. I also believe\n",
      "now what I doubted, that whilst doing so one misty day,\n",
      "Dundee sealers against Newfoundlanders, referee, silver\n",
      "whistle and all in great style, a bear intervened and took\n",
      "their walrus bladder football; what a sweet picture in greys\n",
      "that would make, the sailor-men bolting for the ship, their[220]\n",
      "dark clothes look so delicate and ethereal on the floe in this\n",
      "fine mist, and to see a bear’s faint yellow coat in contrast!\n",
      "Our party came back towing a drift pine stem which we\n",
      "had spotted far off on the ice from the mast-head. Quite\n",
      "an important find in the wide world of ice. They towed\n",
      "it to the ship with a lasso.\n",
      "Gisbert and the writer did quite a lot of lasso practice,\n",
      "partly at a stick set in ice, partly at our dog, as it ran to fetch\n",
      "a glove—great sport for us, but the dog soon showed a\n",
      "desire to climb on board by the rope ladder. As we cut\n",
      "off the ice-worn root with our ice axe we discussed the\n",
      "possible journeyings of the pine stem; from its roots we knew\n",
      "it had grown on rocky ground, from the rings, its slow growth\n",
      "and age, and consequently of the climate it had survived in;\n",
      "from the known currents and drifts we calculated it came\n",
      "from far-away eastwards, say from the Lena river in Siberia.\n",
      "When tired of lassoing, De Gisbert showed me something\n",
      "about splitting logs. I am not a great expert with an axe,\n",
      "and he is rather, he cut his sea-boot soon almost through\n",
      "the leather of the inside of the instep without cutting his foot.\n",
      "To show him what I could do, with a mighty welt I split a\n",
      "log, and the axe glanced and cut my instep through the sea-boot\n",
      "and two pairs of stockings. A chopped tree and a\n",
      "chopped foot may not appear to have wide or deep interest\n",
      "to anyone but the owner of the foot, and may not seem worthy\n",
      "of record in such Arctic notes as these. But let us pause\n",
      "and consider, if there is not something wonderful and almost\n",
      "inexplicable in this apparently trifling incident. Here you\n",
      "have East meeting East, North meeting North! A “gentleman\n",
      "of Scotland born” proceeds by a devious route from Edinburgh\n",
      "via Hull to an ice-floe in the North Polar basin. And\n",
      "here, from some unknown river in far Siberia, possibly the\n",
      "Lena, by the great polar current, after possibly years of\n",
      "voyaging, comes this lonely barkless pine stem, and they\n",
      "meet. And the gentleman chops the extremity of the tree\n",
      "with the ship’s axe and his own extremity at the same time—namely\n",
      "his left instep, as before mentioned. Does not this\n",
      "incident, though trifling in itself, recall the divine words of\n",
      "the Immortal William: “There’s a divinity that shapes[221]\n",
      "our ends, rough hew them how we will.” Perhaps, without\n",
      "any claim to originality, we may, under the circumstances,\n",
      "be allowed to conclude, from the above combination of\n",
      "circumstances, that the world is small.\n",
      "So the snow had other red than the bear’s. Gisbert got\n",
      "his “first aid” out within a second of the time I had got my\n",
      "own, he is very quick: but the captain was first with his,\n",
      "and Archie administered a small tot of medicine from three\n",
      "bens and three glens which he had brought in a little flask\n",
      "all the way from Arthur Lodge, Edinburgh. It will be a\n",
      "sell if I cannot go on one foot after the next bear or\n",
      "whale.\n",
      "About these North Polar basin currents we have many\n",
      "interesting talks, for De Gisbert has studied them for many\n",
      "years. He has asked me to accompany the Spanish expedition\n",
      "in the vessel which will accompany his Spanish Government\n",
      "ship as far as Cape Tsdieljulskin. This possibly\n",
      "because as an artist he is so well content with trying to\n",
      "depict effects of his “end of the garden,” most possibly\n",
      "because his, Gisbert’s, wife and child are to go so far,\n",
      "and as she is a Campbell-Gibson she naturally dotes on the\n",
      "bagpipes.\n",
      "At night the mist cleared up a little and we made some\n",
      "miles to west, pushing through floes. When we came to a\n",
      "blue fresh-water pool on one, we again set to work and bailed\n",
      "our tanks full of fresh water.\n",
      "Then on again, charging the floes with many a bump,\n",
      "which is rather alarming to those of our party who are not\n",
      "salted to such shocks. We hope the floes won’t close up\n",
      "behind us altogether, but when you enter the pack, as the\n",
      "whalers say, “there’s no looking over the shoulder,” and\n",
      "one must take risks in all occupations.\n",
      "To-day we had a splendid bear chase, none the worse\n",
      "because our prey escaped. The morning was exquisite, the\n",
      "mist rose and lay in lavender wisps across the distance of\n",
      "the floes, and the sun shone and the sea became a cheery\n",
      "glittering dark blue, and you could hardly keep your eyes[222]\n",
      "open when you came out of the cabin for the blaze of light.\n",
      "What a change, everything sharp and clear, compared to the\n",
      "veiled misty ice effects of last week!\n",
      "We were at breakfast and would have liked time for a\n",
      "pipe before the news came: “An ice-bear!” and over the\n",
      "bows on to the floe by the rope ladder five of us scrambled.\n",
      "The writer was armed with a heavy double 475, and cartridges\n",
      "the size of asparagus, said to be unnecessarily heavy,\n",
      "but Hamilton’s last monster bear took five of his 355 magnum,\n",
      "all in pretty good places. It seems to me that a really big\n",
      "bear would be more surely killed by a heavy 475 or 500.[16]\n",
      "Bad luck it was to have to travel with a cut foot, and\n",
      "doubly bad at the very start to make a false step and go\n",
      "head first into a hole in the floe, and to get wet through, with\n",
      "waders full at the start. However, Archie cleverly caught\n",
      "the rifle and gave me a hand out, and I got rid of some of\n",
      "the water in the way all anglers are familiar with—that is,\n",
      "lying on your back and holding up your feet, a few “tut\n",
      "tuts,” and we proceeded over hard snow, when we could get\n",
      "it, wading blue shallows from time to time. Two of our\n",
      "seamen went flanking about a mile out on to the floe and we\n",
      "beat up half-a-mile from sea-edge, aiming at the place where\n",
      "we had seen the bears from the crow’s nest, a female with\n",
      "two cubs. The chill of the early start, cold water and the\n",
      "soreness of the foot wore off as we slowly covered mile after\n",
      "mile; sometimes walking was merely a struggle, soft snow\n",
      "covering blocks of ice with horrid pitfalls, other times over[223]\n",
      "crisp, glittering, sunlit beds of icicles set in blue, level as a\n",
      "mat, tumbling into glittering fragments as we crunched\n",
      "across. But our trail was all in vain; from blocks and\n",
      "hummocks we spied the plains and could not find our bears.\n",
      "They had made a wide circuit, gone down wind, and got ours,\n",
      "I expect, and had gone clean away, and as the floe was, say,\n",
      "twenty miles across and all over hummocks, they were soon\n",
      "lost to sight, even from the mast-head.\n",
      "Coming back at leisure we had more time to enjoy the\n",
      "warm sun and the colouring. There were three distinct\n",
      "blues. Behind our little white ship at the floe-edge the sea\n",
      "glittered deep blue, like Oxford blue; on the floe between\n",
      "us and the ship there was spread a wide pond of shallow\n",
      "water, lighter than Cambridge blue, and the pigeon-grey sky\n",
      "showed patches of light peacock-blue.\n",
      "A change of clothes, a redressed foot by Captain Svendsen—one\n",
      "of the lightest handed surgeons I have met—and some\n",
      "bear-steak and we started steaming round the floe, pretty\n",
      "sure of getting our glasses on to the bears before many hours\n",
      "were past. For hours we watched with glasses and telescope\n",
      "from the bridge and crow’s nest the passing white and\n",
      "grey plains and snowy fantastic rock scenes till we almost\n",
      "slept with the continual concentration of the eye on the\n",
      "moving white scene. But alas, at five P.M., the mist came\n",
      "down again, so again we put our ship’s nose against the ice-floe\n",
      "and we pray now that the mist may lift. The skipper\n",
      "and Gisbert took advantage of this pause to make an Artificial\n",
      "horizon with tar in a plate, and tried to find our position by\n",
      "same with sun on the tar surface. But the tar congealed off\n",
      "the level, and after calculations in decimals, yards in length,\n",
      "we find our position is two hundred miles inside the north-east\n",
      "coast of Greenland!\n",
      "Before midnight, with the sun still high above the horizon,\n",
      "the mist lifted and again we go plodding round another huge\n",
      "floe. We cannot get west yet, enormous floes bar our way,\n",
      "there is a narrow passage, say two hundred yards wide, to\n",
      "west between two counties of ice, but it is too narrow for us\n",
      "to venture through. Should the floes close we would be\n",
      "imprisoned before we had time to retreat.\n",
      "[224]\n",
      "It is almost incredible, there is a feeling of movement to-day,\n",
      "the 17th July, quite a perceptible sense of pitch and\n",
      "roll. You notice it even without looking. The living movement\n",
      "of the sea—for ten days we have been “in the ice,”\n",
      "with smooth water. How welcome is this open water. A\n",
      "clear road lies before us to Greenland—why should the ice\n",
      "this year lie across our track in such fields, making us take\n",
      "fifteen days for a distance we expected to cover in four?\n",
      "Perhaps it was as well we met it; though there were no\n",
      "whales there were at least bears, so we have their valuable\n",
      "skins and seal blubber, and our two live bears to make up\n",
      "our cargo. They bring rather an unpleasing aroma at times\n",
      "into the pure Arctic air. Their cages are in parts becoming\n",
      "more and more thick, with stumps of the two-inch battens,\n",
      "which they have eaten their way through. We begin to\n",
      "wonder how to get one of them across from Trömso to\n",
      "Edinburgh, for it would be awkward if they eat their way\n",
      "through on a passenger steamer. Mem: Keep on practising\n",
      "lasso and throwing hitches and pistol practice.\n",
      "At three this morning, twenty minutes to three to be\n",
      "exact, and in Don José’s watch, we spotted a bear on the\n",
      "great floe we were hanging about yesterday; a bear and two\n",
      "cubs, probably the bear of yesterday, and he and Gisbert\n",
      "went off armed cap-à-pie, and the writer could not but be\n",
      "amused at the old lady’s cleverness, though it was at the\n",
      "expense of our companions. It was a mile away, but with a\n",
      "fine glass every movement could be followed, and with no\n",
      "glass to aid its sight it could apparently follow our movements.\n",
      "It stood up its full height, craned its neck to one\n",
      "side or the other, then got on all-fours and spoke to its cubs,\n",
      "and they set off up wind, then it turned round, took another\n",
      "spy at our friends, who soon looked like little black dots\n",
      "amongst the waste of floe, ice hummocks and pinnacles,\n",
      "little lakes and shallow valleys, and as they pursued their\n",
      "way steadily to where the bears had been seen, it made a\n",
      "wide sweep to their left and got away farther even than we\n",
      "could follow it from the mast. I made a jotting from the\n",
      "telescope as per over page, which gives an idea of the kind\n",
      "of going.\n",
      "A Polar Bear\n",
      "[225]\n",
      "I would know that long cunning female again, I believe,\n",
      "were I to meet her, from the odd movements, from her “out-stretched\n",
      "neck and ever watchful eye.” The cubs should be\n",
      "grateful for such a mother; without her skill in character-reading,\n",
      "they would both be in little cages on board here!\n",
      "Does it not make the reader comfortable to know that they\n",
      "are at liberty, free to enjoy seal-killing and fat galore, and\n",
      "pure snow and air and the Arctic world to roam in? When\n",
      "they would not follow fast enough Mother Bear turned and\n",
      "spoke angrily, then finally went and spanked them. A bear\n",
      "and a monkey are the only animals, excepting\n",
      "man, who spank their young. So\n",
      "up here you see little domestic touches in\n",
      "bear life, which, so far, you cannot get in\n",
      "a zoo. It is worth coming north to see\n",
      "such a matron tending her young, to see\n",
      "the jolly round yellow cubs full of fun,\n",
      "gambolling over the fine old mother,\n",
      "playing with her ears and head and teeth\n",
      "that at half-a-bite could take a man’s\n",
      "head off like asparagus. Here is a picture\n",
      "of such a group. “Rest after Play,” it\n",
      "should perhaps be called. “True till\n",
      "Death” might be too harrowing.\n",
      "Sometimes fatal accidents occur in bear-hunting. I have\n",
      "heard of several, but they are small in number compared to\n",
      "the number of bears shot. A few years ago Gisbert witnessed\n",
      "one. Two Norwegian sealers came on an ice-floe after two\n",
      "bears somewhere east of Spitzbergen, and they killed one\n",
      "and set to work skinning it. The second bear was holding\n",
      "towards Gisbert’s vessel, so one of the Norwegians hurried off\n",
      "to annex it by himself, which is not a very safe thing to do.\n",
      "He pursued it some time and wounded it, and the bear went\n",
      "for him, and his rifle jammed, and when De Gisbert’s party\n",
      "came up a little while afterwards the man was in ribbons.\n",
      "Now I hope we may stop writing about bears and soon\n",
      "come in touch with our older friends, the whales, of one kind\n",
      "or another. We are prepared for Balean whales, or Nord\n",
      "Cappers, “the old kind,” I call them. But for the big[226]\n",
      "stronger Finners we are not prepared. I have written about\n",
      "these in a previous chapter—about the special tackle required\n",
      "to master their enormous strength. “Modern whales,”\n",
      "I call them, or Finners, the largest animal that exists in this\n",
      "world, or ever has existed, up to one hundred and twenty\n",
      "feet; longer than the prehistoric Diplodocus. The Balean\n",
      "whale or Mysticetus that used to be fished here, and which\n",
      "has grown so scarce, though it is generally depicted destroying\n",
      "boats, is a fat, leisurely “fish” compared to these bigger\n",
      "and more active Finners, but alas, he is now not only scarce\n",
      "but is also very shy and wary.\n",
      "Forty-five miles we plod along, with northerly strong wind,\n",
      "and pass two of what they call icebergs here—“ice chips”\n",
      "down South—a grey sky ribbed like sea-sand overhead, with\n",
      "the light off snow land on the sky; a yellowish cold glare\n",
      "to the westward; that is Greenland, and we at last pull up\n",
      "against the land-floe. It is just the same as the big sea-floes\n",
      "which we have been amongst, still it is against the land!\n",
      "Twenty-five miles of it we guess; when the haze over it lifts\n",
      "we shall see Greenland’s icy mountains. The days of heat\n",
      "and basking in the blooming saxifrage and yellow poppies\n",
      "seem still far away. But patience—if you wait for ever so\n",
      "long you sometimes get your heart’s desire.\n",
      "The strong wind from north and west is cutting off bits\n",
      "of this land-floe of all sizes, from a yard wide to a mile or\n",
      "two, and so taking them down to cool our north temperate\n",
      "zone. I wish the process had begun sooner, so that we\n",
      "now might be nearer land in shallow soundings looking for\n",
      "walrus. I sincerely desire to see them, as I think my\n",
      "heavy ·475 would have the chance of its life as against\n",
      "the smaller bore rifles we have with us. You have to shoot\n",
      "them, then harpoon them before they sink; when one is\n",
      "harpooned the others rally round and there is wild work.\n",
      "Whales, musk oxen and walrus, coupled with a bee humming\n",
      "in the Greenland meadows, is my desire. It is said there are\n",
      "mosquitoes, but for none of the breed have I any desire,\n",
      "either little or big, from Bassein Creek or Seringapatam.\n",
      "They do say, however, that the Greenland specimen does\n",
      "not have any fever on its proboscis.\n",
      "[227]\n",
      "Whales at last in our night watch! I must write\n",
      "my notes about them before I turn in. Some people say\n",
      "whaling is not sport. I differ from them. It is the best\n",
      "sport I know. We had bear and whale in the same basket\n",
      "to-night, first a cast for a whale which went off, and then\n",
      "immediately after a shot at a bear which we got, and then\n",
      "another whale, which we got also, both within two hours.\n",
      "Certainly though it was only a narwhal the whale was the\n",
      "best sport.\n",
      "We lie in a small bay the length of our small vessel, which\n",
      "is one hundred and ten feet in length, and to our left hand\n",
      "there is a bigger bay in the floe, about two hundred yards\n",
      "wide, and narwhals have appeared in it. So we dropped\n",
      "our whale-boat with the harpoon-gun loaded and put the\n",
      "line in order. This, of course, should have been all in order\n",
      "and ready, so time was lost. Then we tumbled on board by\n",
      "the port chains and rowed down to where the whales had\n",
      "last appeared; and waited for them to come up again.\n",
      "It blew a little with cold, fine snow. As we waited someone\n",
      "on board shouted “A bear!” and we cast our eyes down\n",
      "wind to the ice-floe and got a glimpse of pale primrose\n",
      "passing amongst hummocks; and very quickly we got\n",
      "the harpoon out of the gun and backed down as fast as\n",
      "possible, getting into a bit of a sea, and as we approached\n",
      "the floe I got two 475 shells into the rifle. As we came\n",
      "within fifty yards up came Bruin, making towards us.\n",
      "It was very difficult to hold straight, for the sea was\n",
      "breaking in foam and the boat was tossed about amongst\n",

      "board us. So lest he should change his mind and bolt, I\n",
      "let loose at about eight yards and tried to hit the middle\n",
      "of its chest, but I was a trifle off and hit the point of his\n",
      "starboard shoulder—with such a heavy rifle and big ball\n",
      "and cartridge we would have expected to knock him over,\n",
      "but it only turned it! The second barrel hit him a little\n",
      "high and back of the shoulder, and he tumbled out of sight\n",
      "over a hummock. So we made wild jumps on to broken ice[228]\n",
      "in the foam and scrambled on to the floe and over very\n",
      "rugged hummocks for a few yards, and put in a third shot,\n",
      "which seemed to finish it, and Svendsen and two men hurried\n",
      "on to get the body, for the ice was closing round us, but\n",
      "they found it still breathing, so Gisbert and I, who were\n",
      "keeping the boat off the floe-edge, backed in again, and with\n",
      "difficulty handed the rifle to Svendsen, who put in another\n",
      "bullet, and with a rope the three dragged it over the snow\n",
      "towards the boat. It was a mighty drag even for the\n",
      "distance of a hundred yards. Then we backed in again\n",
      "through the surf at ice-edge and Svendsen and the men\n",
      "struggled into the boat with the line, and we hurriedly pulled\n",
      "and shoved off, for some heavy ice was closing round us, and\n",
      "got out just in time, with the bear floating in tow. In the\n",
      "rough water clear of ice, we managed, with another struggle\n",
      "and without upsetting, to pull the bear on board and rowed\n",
      "back to the ship, greatly rejoicing! Just as we got it heaved\n",
      "on board by the steam-winch, much to my relief, I spotted\n",

      "I have been at the killing of much bigger whales, but this\n",
      "spotted black-and-white fellow with the horn in his nose,\n",
      "plus the bear, was to my mind as interesting a little hunt as\n",
      "any. Sometimes a rabbit stalk is of more interest than that\n",
      "of a deer! A fine black-and-white-spotted fellow showed\n",
      "with a great ivory unicorn, but out of shot. Then another,\n",
      "more brown in colour, appeared, and Svendsen let drive.\n",
      "The harpoon shot was excellent and very quick, away went\n",
      "the line, I do not know for how many fathoms—we passed\n",
      "it aft and all hauled in and let out and hauled in again,\n",
      "finally we came alongside the whale, with its circle of\n",
      "splashing and foam, and it raised its tail, and we put in\n",
      "a big bullet from the 475, which went from its stem to its\n",
      "bow, and it collapsed instantly. It was a surprisingly\n",
      "killing shot, for one bullet to kill the whale, and yet the\n",
      "bear took three to stop it. We hove our line in short, and\n",
      "set to work to tow the whale alongside and began to flense\n",
      "it—that is, to strip the blubber off the carcass—and were[229]\n",
      "all very pleased, and were just drawing the harpoon from the\n",
      "gun, which we had reloaded, when again whales appeared in\n",
      "our little ice bay. So we again threw our oilskins into the\n",
      "boat and went off again. In our bay we waited twenty\n",
      "minutes by the watch, and up one came again, a better one\n",
      "than our first was leading: it was white, with black spots.\n",
      "Our first was brown, with white markings. We very nearly\n",
      "got the harpoon into it, but it only showed for a second or\n",
      "two each rise and it escaped. So more waiting in wet cold\n",
      "wind, with a lot of bears’ blood, and snow and water under\n",
      "foot: but this journey we had each a tot of aqua vite. So\n",
      "we waited and waited again, just as you wait for a rising\n",
      "trout—only with a little more subdued excitement and\n",
      "perhaps more than usual wet and cold: and again the handsome\n",
      "beasts appeared, and we dashed after them, three pairs\n",
      "of oars, but they went off under the floe and we waited again\n",
      "till endurance ceased, and, very wet, and cold, and shivering,\n",
      "we got aboard for supper at four in the morning. Three\n",

      "This is the old style of gun and harpoon which we have\n",

      "invented the harpoon for the great finners of modern whaling?\n",
      "He was a man of remarkable determination and strength\n",

      "This is one of them:\n",
      "To show how his new harpoon worked, he took his wife\n",

      "finner with his new harpoon and line, and was he not a proud\n",
      "man? But the harpoon struck the whale too far aft and did\n",
      "not disable it. It took out the whole line and with a rush\n",
      "took their little steamer in tow at a terrible speed out of the\n",
      "fiord for twelve hours at fifteen knots against a gale, and\n",

      "to stop the speed.\n",
      "“Let go, let go,” prayed the wife, “I am seek, I am\n",
      "afraid.” “No, no,” said Foyn, “I vill never let go. I\n",
      "vill show you veech is de strongest my vill or de vill of de\n",

      "Cap to look out for whales in the offing and there came\n",
      "such a clap of wind that it blew the great Foyn down and\n",
      "hurt his person and his dignity. But on looking round he\n",
      "found Yensen slowly getting to his feet, muttering: “That\n",
      "was a terrible blast, Captain.” Yensen had really not felt it\n",
      "at all, so he saved Foyn’s feelings.\n",
      "His new industry has been the making of Southern Norway\n",
      "and half of Tönsberg. But the Tönsberg people remember\n",
      "him with mixed feelings. They would not subscribe capital\n",
      "to their townsman’s new venture; not only that, but they\n",
      "insisted on his doing all his whale factory work outside the\n",
      "town. “All right,” he said, “if you won’t take a share in\n",
      "the business I will give you the ‘smell,’” and he built his[234]\n",
      "works to windward and made many hundreds per cent.\n",
      "profit for years, and the Tönsberg people only got the smell.\n",

      "deep growl or groan, something like a bear or a cow, a deep\n",
      "note which seemed to come from the floe across the little bay\n",

      "are gone! off under the ice, and again we lie idly waiting.\n",
      "Then Archie whistles from the ship and signals that he has\n",

      "their dumpy feeble tail, C, as also does the sperm D, before\n",
      "the long dive. The rorquals’ tails are magnificent appendages,\n",
      "and it is often thrown clear of the sea when such\n",
      "a whale is “fast” or harpooned E. The sperm can make a\n",
      "big swipe with his tail; it is apparently more elastic in the\n",

      "sight; he runs fast along the surface, every second leaping\n",
      "clear out, or at least going, as it were, on his tail, and thumps[236]\n",
      "down with a crash of spray. Though I have seen thousands\n",
      "of Finners I have only seldom seen them leaping clear of the\n",
      "water, but here is a jotting of one that rose several times\n",
      "within thirty yards of us—close enough! leap after leap,\n",
      "its tail ten feet clear of the sea, head first, straight up into\n",

      "kid, ribbed like corduroy, its back grey, glittering in the\n",
      "sun (see page 235).\n",
      "We left our sheltered ice bay this morning, 19th July,\n",
      "because the mist lifted and the sky hung in level lilac bands\n",
      "above the ice-floes, and we got a few hours’ further steaming\n",
      "through the ice towards the coast. And I am rather sorry.\n",
      "For we had got to know the biggest ice features of that bay,\n",
      "and the fishing and shooting were worth quite a good rent—two\n",
      "bears, one narwhal and lots of hunting for other bears\n",
      "in two days. I would have stayed a week more there myself\n",
      "and so would Gisbert, as we are both very keen about\n",
      "the narwhals, but the others were not, and thought there\n",
      "wasn’t much chance of getting within shot.\n",
      "I must say the narwhals were provoking, rising trout in\n",
      "a chalk stream are not more wary, still there was always a\n",
      "chance. I’d have given a good deal to land one of these\n",
      "splendid ivory horns. Time after time we got almost within\n",
      "harpooning distance and the group of long spotted black\n",
      "and white backs would signal to each other and quietly disappear\n",
      "and sink. We stalked or rowed as quietly as possible\n",
      "to one lot, and I had half a chance and let drive but the\n",
      "harpoon struck water just a foot short of the nearest and\n",
      "biggest. What a flourish of tails and spray there was as\n",
      "they plunged and left great quiet swirls in the rippling water;\n",
      "our boat and hearts bobbing but no whale fast to a straining\n",

      "tears for a missed or lost whale.\n",
      "Svendsen, who has only done bottle-nose harpooning, was\n",
      "put on for next chance and did exactly as I had done, only\n",
      "he got his hand cut through the butt of the harpoon-gun\n",
      "being a bit loose. Truth is, our gear, guns and line on the[237]\n",
      "Fonix are rotten. He told me a curious thing that happened\n",
      "with him a year or two ago; whilst bottle-nosing his mate\n",
      "had made miss after miss at whales with the harpoon, and\n",
      "coming alongside he said: “By G⸺, if I can’t hit a whale I’ll\n",
      "hit a gull” (fulmar petrels were, as usual, round the vessel),\n",
      "so he blew at one and the harpoon cut it in two! But a\n",
      "bottle-nose is an easier mark, to my mind, than the narwhal.\n",
      "Narwhals are apt to show so little above water—only about\n",
      "four to ten inches, and that only for a second as a rule.\n",
      "Almost at every watch we heard their groanings and went\n",
      "after them. Sometimes we thought we heard the sound\n",
      "coming from under the water. I am sure we did.\n",
      "Our biggest disappointment came at night—two in the\n",
      "morning rather. A bear was spotted—a bear on the far side\n",
      "of our loch, and Gisbert went off with some men in the whale-boat\n",
      "and we watched in our night clothes (much the same as\n",
      "day clothes in the Arctic) and saw the captain do a record\n",
      "sprint over the floe to turn the bear towards the gun, but the\n",
      "bear that at first seemed inclined to come and pass the time\n",
      "of day changed his mind and went ambling away, giving us\n",
      "a stern view till only its black nose and mouth were visible,\n",
      "as it looked round occasionally, and then it vanished in the\n",
      "lilac distance amongst the snow hummocks, and the writer\n",
      "turned in, thinking the play was over. But this morning, I\n",
      "am told, the real disappointment came. They gave up the\n",
      "bear, for a large black-and-white narwhal, with a magnificent\n",
      "horn, appeared round the ice point and they rowed round\n",
      "for it. It was lying leisurely on the surface, only going below\n",
      "occasionally. Gisbert was to take the harpoon. They\n",
      "made a splendid approach, breathlessly still, oars not making\n",
      "a sound, and got within five yards! And the whale rose\n",
      "high out of the water and Gisbert pulled the trigger, and the\n",
      "gun missed fire. The cap that explodes the powder had\n",
      "been withdrawn for safety, when they began the bear-chase,\n",
      "and not replaced! You can imagine the disappointment.\n",
      "I can assure the reader that such an approach, the approach\n",
      "and hunting of any whale, in fact, is far more exciting than\n",
      "one’s first stag or bear. There is more risk than in bear-hunting.\n",
      "But a danger of the narwhal is that if you make[238]\n",
      "fast to a young one the rest of the family, parents and\n",
      "relatives, are down on you and you have a chance of getting\n",
      "the great ivory spear through your boat. There is all the\n",
      "possibility of lines and legs getting mixed, boat upset, or\n",
      "dragged under floes, and lots more, if you care to tot them up.\n",
      "Curiously, there have been far more lives lost at bottle-nose\n",
      "whaling than at that of the larger kinds (the bottle-nose\n",
      "and narwhal are about the same size). A bottle-nose is not\n",
      "larger than the narwhal, but it goes off with such a dash\n",
      "that I have known several men to have been carried overboard—Captain\n",
      "Larsen for one. He told me he went over\n",
      "with coil round his leg, and another man in front; he got\n",
      "loose but the other man never came up again.\n",

      "seldom or never known to check its first rush. This one did,\n",
      "slacked the line and Svend Foyn came to the surface and\n",
      "struck out and clambered on board, where the mate stood\n",
      "white with horror, and all the welcome he could muster was:\n",
      "“I—I—I am afraid you are wet, Captain!” and Foyn\n",
      "laughed himself dry....\n",
      "Then Fortune gave a belated smile on our adventurers.\n",

      "far side. Our boat having gone round after this narwhal,\n",
      "was therefore able to spot something moving across the calm\n",
      "water, and when the object got to the floe and crawled out\n",
      "on to the ice, great was their rejoicing to find their bear\n",
      "again. So they pursued it again and killed it with one head\n",
      "shot, one in the neck, and three in the body. It was a small\n",
      "bear, a female about three metres, thirty centimetres—that\n",
      "is, seven feet six inches—and had bad teeth and looked old!\n",
      "My last, about the same length, had splendid teeth and\n",
      "looked young. This accepted measurement, which we\n",
      "take from nose to tail, does not give a true impression of the\n",
      "size of a bear, for this bear standing up would be about nine\n",
      "feet in height. I do not see why we should not measure a\n",
      "bear standing up as we measure man, from top of his head\n",
      "to his heel. We never think of giving a man’s height in feet[239]\n",
      "and inches from top of head to the seat of his trousers.\n",
      "And, besides, what is the end of a bear’s tail? Is it the\n",
      "flesh and bone or longest hair? I’ve seen a hair about five\n",
      "inches long on a bear’s tail, and including the water dripping\n",
      "from that you would have thought, by the measurements,\n",
      "it beat the record.\n",
      "[240]\n",
      "Before we left our last misty anchorage we partook\n",
      "of a meal of both bear and narwhal. The narwhal’s\n",
      "flesh is blacker than an old mushroom, and\n",
      "as food it is only passable. Young bear is our best\n",
      "food, but there is a lot of trouble about preparing it, for we\n",
      "remove all the fat, which has not a good taste.\n",
      "This morning one of these little grey seals or floe rats\n",
      "looked at us from astern, and as I plan a motoring coat I\n",
      "felt called upon to deprive it of its pelt, painlessly, after\n",
      "administering a tabloid—lead in nickel. I do not think\n",
      "there is any sport in shooting seals without a pucca stalk,\n",
      "still, the skins of these little grey fellows (Vitulina, or are\n",
      "they a new species?) are too good to leave. I think six will\n",
      "be enough for a coat. I have got three now.\n",
      "The flippers of the seals here are highly developed, with\n",
      "distinct claws. In the Antarctic the flippers are less distinctly\n",
      "articulated. The finger-bones are more bound together by\n",
      "ligament, and the claws or nails are scarcely noticeable.\n",
      "All day we travelled north and as westerly as possible,\n",
      "trying to get within sight of Greenland, and for once the\n",
      "sun came out and we felt as if we could paint on deck, and\n",
      "did so for a little—dead smooth sea, with fine icicles forming\n",
      "and very level fields of ice, with few hummocks, extending\n",
      "to the pigeon-grey ribbed sky on horizon—rather monotonous.\n",
      "The guitar was going somewhere on board and most of us\n",
      "cooling our heels in the silence. Only the captive bears\n",
      "seem busy—grate, grate, grating at their wooden walls;\n",
      "one got nearly out last night, when we were off after the\n",
      "narwhal. We saw excited figures jumping about on our\n",
      "foredeck, and when we came alongside there was fierce\n",
      "growling, poor old Port bear being prodded in the back to\n",
      "draw its attention, whilst three seamen struggled to nail on\n",
      "new wood in front of its nose-end of the cage.\n",
      "[241]\n",
      "But to come back to this day that begins so quietly,\n",
      "we are now all agog, we had a splendid bear-hunt and\n",
      "spotted a female with cub, a very small thing, and it was\n",
      "fascinating watching all their movements and signs to each\n",
      "other. We tried to jam the ship to the floe-edge, but for\n",
      "hundreds of yards it was guarded by floating pan ice—that\n",
      "is, ice in cakes of a few yards diameter and not deep, only,\n",
      "say, a foot. A big whaler could have jammed through comfortably,\n",
      "but we are not strong enough and got stuck and\n",
      "retired as gracefully as possible and went a long round of\n",
      "miles and miles to where we could land on the true floe,\n",
      "practising lasso en route in case we may have another\n",
      "opportunity of throwing a rope over a live wild bear.\n",
      "Later we spotted the bear and child, and Archie and party\n",
      "went off after it, and from board ship we watched their slow\n",
      "procedure and the bears’ rapid disappearance. I thought\n",
      "then that the fun was over, and retired to draw—but they\n",
      "had the best stalk they have had. They struck the spoor\n",
      "of a bigger single bear, followed it by directions from mast-head,\n",
      "and came within a short distance, when the sleeping\n",
      "hero awoke, and promptly stalked them, then Archie fired\n",
      "at forty yards. He says: “Give me pheasant-shooting and\n",
      "a covert side, and nothing on four legs bigger than a spaniel.”\n",
      "It is rather an awesome thing seeing a fellow in white robes\n",
      "and formidable teeth, that when on his bare feet stands well\n",
      "over ten feet high. A cordite rifle is then a very comfortable\n",
      "thing to hold in your hand. The first bullet in the chest\n",
      "knocked the bear over and two more shots killed it. It took\n",
      "about five hours there and back to finish the bloody business.\n",
      "And even on their tramp home we on board were kept in\n",
      "interest, for Don José Herrero, with the captain, went out for\n",
      "a fourth bear—relationship to others not known—Svendsen\n",
      "tried to draw the bear after him, whilst Don José hid behind\n",
      "a hummock. A bear will always attack a single man, sometimes\n",
      "two, seldom a number, and the plan worked effectively\n",
      "up to a point. It was lovely to watch Svendsen’s simulated\n",
      "frightened flight and the bear following, stalking him behind\n",
      "every hummock, keeping cover, and then scuttling across\n",
      "the open to make sure of its victim. But somehow or other[242]\n",
      "the bear did not just come far enough and our second lot\n",
      "of hunters came back with nothing in the bag. Later, we\n",
      "noticed the same bear working along the horizon. I expect\n",
      "it will strike the track of the homeward drawn bear’s skin.\n",
      "I hope he will evince sufficient interest in his deceased relative\n",
      "either to follow the trail of the skin to the ship or to the\n",
      "carcass; it was far too great a distance to bring in all the\n",
      "flesh. An eight-foot bear, nose to tail, ten feet four inches\n",
      "nose to heel, is a frightful weight, about nine hundred and\n",
      "eighty pounds.\n",
      "It is still the Spaniards’ watch and we steam away back\n",
      "to where we saw the bears first—if we cannot find whales we\n",
      "must take bears—En falta de pan, buenas son tortas (If you\n",
      "cannot get bread, cakes are good enough), and if you cannot\n",
      "get either bears or whales you must either draw, write,\n",
      "smoke, or go to bed. I would go to bed, but still have a\n",
      "lingering interest in my fellows’ proceedings with the above\n",
      "ursidæ.\n",
      "After the somewhat exciting afternoon and evening after\n",
      "bear, the night felt very quiet. Mist fell and stilled the\n",
      "least ripple. Archie came to my cabin—two can sit in it\n",
      "with a squeeze—and celebrated the occasion with a pipe and\n",
      "a glass of aqua vite, and he retold his adventures. I ought\n",
      "to have been with him, I believe, as comrade, to draw a bead\n",
      "on the ferocious opponent if necessary, and afterwards put\n",
      "it all down in paint, but Gisbert is most unerring in his aim,\n",
      "and being a little lame, I might have kept them back. At\n",
      "eighty yards, a big bear, Hamilton says, is very imposing,\n",
      "and when it stalks you to within thirty-five yards and you\n",
      "give it your best in a vital spot and it is not killed, you are[243]\n",
      "inclined to wish yourself at home. You think of what will\n",
      "happen if your foot sticks in the deep snow or if you miss\n",
      "with your next, or only wound it. The size and shape of\n",
      "these wild floe-bred bears is far greater than any one may see\n",
      "in captivity. I suppose the age of the males, their food, and\n",
      "free life account for their enormous chest measurements\n",
      "and huge bowed forelegs.\n",
      "It is certainly best to attack a bear in couples, on account\n",
      "of above-mentioned possibilities—lives have been lost by not\n",
      "doing so.\n",
      "As we turned in, the mist rose a little and left a streak of\n",
      "palest primrose between it and the horizon, the shape of a\n",
      "great searchlight, but how delicate was the warm violet of\n",
      "the mist and the darker tint on the smooth water. In other\n",
      "ten minutes the light increased, then the sky was faintest\n",
      "yellow, except a low arch of cold bluish tint above the floe\n",
      "to which we were anchored; on the floe were three small\n",
      "icebergs.\n",
      "Where we are to-night there is little life, only a few petrels\n",
      "chuckling quietly at our stern, where there is always some\n",
      "blubber hanging over for their benefit.\n",
      "There is not a ripple on the sea, not the slightest perceptible\n",
      "motion. I think the stillness and silence of the Arctic is a\n",
      "thing seldom noticed; the hundreds of miles of drifting\n",
      "floes which surround us break all swell. Everyone sleeps\n",
      "to-night after the exertions of yesterday. If there is a watch\n",
      "on deck I do not hear him; in my cabin the only sound is the\n",
      "snoring of our starboard bear. His berth is close to mine;\n",
      "when he does not snore he growls, a deep vibrating organ\n",
      "note, which is a little fearsome, and when he stops the deep\n",
      "note there is an ominous scrape, scraping in the stillness,\n",
      "that shows his set purpose to get out, and—what? I wish\n",
      "he was overboard or in our Zoo, or behind iron bars or something\n",
      "stronger than fir-wood battens, which he tears into\n",
      "moss in no time! A rat tearing wood is vexatious in the\n",
      "silence of the night, but to hear the patient and effective\n",
      "work going on beside one when you know there is possibly\n",
      "no one on the look-out, makes one anxious, so I keep my\n",
      "pistol handy at meal-times and between them.\n",
      "[244]\n",
      "An uneventful Sunday. After the manner of our great examples\n",
      "of Reformation times, we held mild sports. Fencing,\n",

      "say who took the prize. Lassoing, five entries, De Gisbert and\n",

      "In evening we tied up to a gap in floe-edge, hoping for\n",
      "narwhals, because they seem to keep close to edge of the\n",
      "floe. And sure enough they came when we were at evening\n",
      "meal, a great black-and-white-spotted bull leading, with a\n",
      "visible gleam under the still, dark water of his white ivory\n",
      "horn; after him, more drab-coloured whales, presumably\n",
      "Madame and bébés. We waited out in our boat, the writer\n",
      "with harpoon, and pursued two lots. One of them was a\n",
      "splendid bull, but both lots vanished a fraction of a second\n",
      "before I got a good chance at them, so we saved powder.\n",
      "During the night we got to some extent embayed. We\n",
      "had floes all round, and raced round like a bird in a trap,\n",
      "but found a way out of the lake about four A.M.\n",
      "As we plodded round in the early morning, it rained!\n",
      "straight down heavy rain and warm at that, with the thermometer\n",
      "two degrees above freezing—most unexpected and\n",
      "unsuitable Arctic weather—might as well have rain at\n",
      "Assouan! When the rain ceased thin mist still hung over\n",
      "the day and it was very quiet indeed.\n",
      "Our Starboard bear seemed to feel the quiet and monotony\n",
      "and made a very good attempt to get out to-night. He did\n",
      "not seem very overpowering on the floe, but now, when he got[245]\n",
      "his head and one great forefoot out and the timber was\n",
      "flying and six men struggling to nail him up, he gave one a\n",
      "sense of great strength. He is now inside the remnants of\n",
      "timber baulks of about three cages. As he chews one batten\n",
      "up more timber is nailed on over the first stumps. Some of us\n",
      "thought the bridge gave a good point of view: the struggling\n",
      "figure, and the steam of its breath as the cage was turned\n",
      "over, and Gisbert’s cigarette smoke as he pulled and\n",
      "hauled and directed the various manœuvres, made a fairly\n",
      "dramatic picture. I thought my services might be called\n",
      "on at any minute with my Browning, but six men,\n",
      "active of mind and body, and various ingenious appliances\n",
      "of tackles and hatchets and big nails, at last made Bruin\n",
      "secure, and the stillness of the misty day come over us\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Later, a great narwhal raised his back and tail right\n",
      "astern, groaned and went under with hardly a ripple, and\n",
      "we saw his white length come towards us under the glassy\n",
      "surface and disappear under the ship. So the whale-boat\n",
      "was lowered and a crew went out and lay a hundred yards\n",
      "off. My fishing instinct told he was the only one about, so\n",
      "I stayed on board and painted an ice effect. The whale-boat\n",
      "and men lay perfectly reflected, and looked almost\n",
      "too still and colourless through the thin mist to be real,\n",
      "looking more like a faded print of people waiting for perch\n",
      "than whalers waiting with stern intent to do or die. Bow\n",
      "lay on his back smoking, the smoke rising straight up, the\n",
      "others chatted in subdued voices.\n",
      "On board, Pedersen the steward started his guitar and\n",
      "mouth-organ, and altogether, with the tum-tum, common\n",
      "waltz music, and the outer stillness it did not feel a bit as it\n",
      "ought to do in the Arctic regions,\n",
      "as the old song goes.\n",
      "I have mentioned our many-sided steward. Photography\n",
      "seems to be another of his accomplishments—hobbies, I[246]\n",
      "should say. Light or no light, he fires his camera. We could\n",
      "not help smiling the other day when he went for the first\n",
      "time on to the floe with a party to photograph a bear-hunt.\n",
      "Hardly had he gone five yards when one leg went deep into\n",
      "a hole in the floe and his shoe came off. He emptied the\n",
      "water, and then the other came off, so he hastily fixed his\n",
      "tripod, fired a shot at the ship and came on board again,\n",
      "and took to the guitar and his proper offices. To-night a\n",
      "sudden idea seized him and he left his cosy corner by our\n",
      "galley fire and Johanna, our “she-cook,” and came with\n",
      "guitar and that instrument called the mouth-organ, and\n",
      "arranged our bears’ heads and skins on the main-hatch, and\n",
      "sat himself down on a block of wood between them and got\n",
      "one of the men to fire his camera at him. But first he produced\n",
      "a pocket-mirror, when I called his attention to a hair\n",
      "being astray, and having arranged that, he pulled his white\n",
      "jacket into position, fixed up the guitar and mouth-organ\n",
      "and struck a fine pose. I might have fired a plate at him,\n",
      "but there was not nearly enough light. The head of\n",
      "Hamilton’s enormous bear, as if resentful of this last indignity\n",
      "of having to pose in such a picture, broke the barrel it rested\n",
      "on as if in protest—even the head and neck is a big lift for\n",
      "one man.\n",
      "Another picture composed itself a little later. We\n",
      "watered ship from one of these shallow blue pools on the\n",
      "floe, two men at the pool filling tin pails with a large tin\n",
      "bailer. To encourage them our jolly, burly vivandière went\n",
      "out to them with her cheery laugh, carrying a glass and\n",
      "bottle of aqua vite. There was colour! and if not elegance,\n",
      "a beauty of fitness, which is saying a good deal for the lady;\n",
      "the ample, strong form, in pale blue and white pinafore kind\n",
      "of dress, tripped over the floe, and the deep blue of the\n",
      "sailors’ clothes and her red cheeks, and the golden yellow\n",
      "of the aquavit, the grey of the zinc pails, and the blue and\n",
      "white of the snow, suddenly struck one as the first decided\n",
      "effect of strong colour contrast which we have seen for\n",
      "days.\n",
      "Nothing very exciting to-day, mist and snow on deck till\n",
      "evening, when it cleared, and became very calm. We were[247]\n",
      "all at aften-mad when word came a bear was sighted, so our\n",
      "Spanish friends armed themselves and went forward to the\n",
      "bows, and the vessel slowly approached the floe on which\n",
      "the bear had been seen, and to our astonishment the bear\n",
      "approached the ship steadily, and lightly climbed a round\n",
      "snow-block and steadily gazed at us, a pale primrose patch\n",
      "in a great whiteness, with interesting dark eyes and muzzle.\n",
      "I have tried to recall the effect, but the highness of the\n",
      "scheme of colour makes it difficult to paint, and probably\n",
      "impossible to reproduce by any process of colour-printing.\n",
      "Our friends calmly held their fire till within twenty-five\n",
      "yards when Don José began with his telescope-sighted\n",
      "mannlicher and hit the bear at his first shot! unfortunately\n",
      "rather near its tail. The bear, enraged, tore at itself. Then a\n",
      "sharp fusillade began from both rifles and by-and-by the\n",
      "bear succumbed. It had been hit not less than five times.\n",
      "It was only a small bear, but, as Don Luis senior remarked:\n",
      "“It was forte bien mieux de tirer from the ship than to go\n",
      "march, march, toujours sur la neige.” This is the way we\n",
      "speak on board, with a little Spanish thrown in.\n",
      "[248]\n",
      "Bright sun for once and away we have been steaming\n",
      "since early morning, south and east, hoping to get\n",
      "clear of the great floes that bar our way to the west.\n",
      "I long for mountains, the flat plains of ice-floe and snow grow\n",
      "very wearisome. Now, near land, these land-floes are like\n",
      "endless plaster ceiling that has dropped more or less in fragments.\n",
      "In the Antarctic the floes look as if a Greek temple\n",
      "had come to bits and lay floating on the sea. There is a\n",
      "considerable difference, therefore, in appearance; at least\n",
      "I speak for the southern ice which I have met south-east\n",
      "of Graham’s Land. There are no seals, therefore we hardly\n",
      "expect bears, and there is never a sign of the blow of a\n",
      "whale. Only one narwhal this morning, we almost ran\n",
      "into it. I wish it had driven its spear into us, it seems\n",
      "the only hope of getting a good one.\n",
      "Floes extend in a line for miles north and south; we\n",
      "think it will be best now to wait for them to open, rather\n",
      "than to wander away south in hopes of getting an opening\n",
      "round them. Shannon Island, on the north-east of Greenland,\n",
      "is our aim.\n",
      "... The floes are flatter, with fewer tombstones protruding\n",
      "from the level white; it gets monotonous. Mist\n",
      "comes at night. Hamilton and Gisbert play chess, Don\n",
      "José and the writer teach each other English and Spanish.\n",
      "Don Luis plays patience and Don José Herrero does nothing,\n",
      "with quiet dignity. This morning, after an hour at Spanish,\n",
      "I turned out first of our party for breakfast and found our\n",
      "starboard bear also on the point of coming out. It had its\n",
      "head and feet out and was only stopped by a single rope, a\n",
      "mere accident, but it puzzled the bear—rope was new to it.\n",
      "The she-cook and writer were the only people on deck. I\n",
      "tried to look not afraid and she certainly looked perfectly\n",
      "cool, and kept on wiping a dish, but went into the galley. I[249]\n",
      "secured my revolver and told the man on the bridge. I\n",
      "took the wheel, whilst he dashed below and called for help,\n",
      "and there ensued a wild struggle; Bruin had lost a moment\n",
      "at the last trifle, the silly rope that was slightly elastic giving\n",
      "way to his pulling. Several of the crew turned up and got\n",
      "some thin wood battens, but one after another, as they were\n",
      "hastily banged across the front, he tore them to bits. And\n",
      "he has learned that shoving is also effective, and six men this\n",
      "morning went back at first, to a shove of his two great paws,\n",
      "till they got leverage. “With a long enough lever you can\n",
      "move the world”—that is where our men came in. Now he\n",
      "has about eight inches of timber in front of his nose. I will\n",

      "says he is sure to go overboard at once if he comes out. I\n",
      "think it is as well to have my pistol beside me at breakfast;\n",
      "we must at least have a chance of some shooting if it takes\n",
      "charge of the ship and does not go overboard as predicted.\n",
      "Gisbert tells at breakfast this touching little tale, possibly\n",
      "a chestnut, above illustrated. “Once upon a time a hunter\n",
      "met a bear and said: ‘Here comes my new fur coat,’ and the\n",
      "bear said: ‘Here comes my breakfast,’ and both were right!”\n",
      "With such frivolity he soothes our nerves. But the deep,\n",
      "vibrating note of Starboard and the sound of industrious\n",
      "scraping keep one on edge for the rasping tearing that\n",
      "comes when he really sets to work to get out. Some great\n",
      "chains have now been found in the bottom of our little hold,\n",
      "and he is now really being treated as a wild animal; the[250]\n",
      "chains are being fastened all round the woodwork, so I will\n",
      "allow him other two days to get free. All our wooden\n",
      "battens are done or nearly done, therefore this resort to\n",
      "iron.\n",
      "We—that is, De Gisbert and I—made a small discovery this\n",
      "morning in rope-throwing—we practise it at odd times, with\n",
      "the prospect in view of tackling other bears alive, which is\n",
      "perhaps even higher sport than shooting or photographing\n",
      "them. For some time we have almost all been able to cast\n",
      "the ordinary running loop at short range, but are erratic\n",
      "with the half-hitch cast, such as you use after casting a loop\n",
      "over a bear’s head to secure its forefoot.\n",
      "I do not write these details for bear-hunters, but the game\n",
      "is excellent sport per se on deck, say, on a P. & O. liner outward\n",
      "bound in August; it would be splendid on any deck,\n",
      "better than deck quoits. It would be excellent for a\n",
      "garden-party or sports for Boy Scouts.\n",
      "[251]\n",
      "You beg or borrow, from the bos’n or laundry-maid, five\n",
      "fathoms of rope—log line is the best. Splice a metal eye\n",
      "to the end to make a loop or lasso. Then you fix up a spar,\n",
      "with a cross-piece, and stand as in this sketch, with the loop—larger\n",
      "than A, or to taste—and cast over B, with right hand,\n",
      "and haul taut with left hand. The next thing is to cast a\n",
      "half-hitch over C. You imagine B is a bear’s head and you\n",
      "wish to throw a half-hitch over (C) a fore paw, so as to haul\n",
      "the paw up to the neck and throw the bear. Then you can\n",
      "try left-hand or right-hand casting over X, which is not so\n",
      "easy!\n",
      "To cast the first lasso loop (note position of hand and eye\n",
      "in loop A) you swing the loop round the head and let fly\n",
      "and let the coils of line in left hand go free. This is a little\n",
      "difficult at first; casting on the half-hitch is much easier if\n",
      "you lay the line properly, as in Fig. (4). If you lay it as we\n",
      "did at first, as in Figs. (1) and (2), the loop falls short as in\n",
      "middle Fig. The idea is to have plenty line to your right,\n",
      "so as to make a big flowing hitch, as shown in lower Fig. (4).\n",
      "Gisbert and I worked out this discovery in the morning till\n",
      "we could put on hitches every time, and in the afternoon we\n",
      "challenged the “Professor,” as we call young Don José—because\n",
      "of his skill in throwing the loop—and his cousin, Don\n",
      "Luis Velasquez, for a bottle of champagne, and holding our\n",
      "hand, we easily beat them and felt very slightly ashamed of ourselves\n",
      "for taking advantage of our small discovery of a knack.\n",
      "[252]\n",
      "This morning in sunny mist appeared a dot, far away over\n",
      "the snow, and we put glasses on it and made out a seal. As\n",
      "our young men thoughtfully hung back from a stalk, it was\n",
      "left for De Gisbert and the writer to make the effort. Finally\n",
      "the writer started over very rough going, with very little\n",
      "chance of getting within shot, still, just to show an example,\n",
      "we felt one of us must try.\n",
      "So we climbed over the bow and got on to the floe-edge and\n",
      "away from ship. It was very charming on the floe amongst\n",
      "these ice tombstones and ledges fringed with huge icicles\n",
      "that, in a wide view, are simply monotonous white, but\n",
      "which all become very sweet and beautiful when you are\n",
      "close to them and can examine the details at leisure. The\n",
      "only way to see nature thoroughly is to have it rubbed into\n",
      "you. Who can see a rainstorm with an umbrella up?\n",
      "When you have one leg in a hole in the floe and the other on\n",
      "the floe, and hands, rifle and staff going, you do not know\n",
      "how deep, there is plenty of time for the dripping icicles\n",
      "over the blue ledge in front of you to impress themselves on\n",
      "your memory; and for a time at least, the seal you are\n",
      "stalking, or even the bear that may be stalking you, or\n",
      "when you think of the beauty in front, the cold in your\n",
      "boots, become of little importance.\n",
      "Then you toil on, dripping from nose and eyebrows just\n",
      "like the icicles, for on this blessed day of days through these\n",
      "mist wreaths there is hot sun and the ice-floe glitters gloriously.\n",
      "Everyone said that the seal could not be approached.\n",
      "But by dint of much consideration and a crawl here and\n",
      "there, I managed to get within a hundred and fifty or a\n",
      "hundred and sixty yards. Then I thought, “Just to show\n",
      "what could be done by old age and experience,” I’d try to\n",
      "get even closer—to a hundred yards—that lost the seal for\n",
      "me; for when I got behind the tiny knob of ice I aimed at the\n",
      "seal had got into its hole in the floe. For the last fifty yards\n",
      "I was following the two or three days’ old track of a bear; I\n",
      "wonder if he and I had both stalked the same seal with the\n",
      "same result.\n",
      "A day’s stalk, or rather a few hours’ stalk, after a seal suits\n",
      "my taste, and Hamilton agrees. He says, apropos of a big[253]\n",
      "serious old bear-stalk: “Give me a pheasant cover, with\n",
      "nothing on four legs bigger than a spaniel.” You don’t\n",
      "then have that sensation of cold water: you are quite comfortable\n",
      "and can claw down your birds and chat with any\n",
      "fair one who has begged to see you do it.\n",
      "From above, the careful reader may gather that we have at\n",
      "least in this Greenland sea seen the sun. It is nice! Now,\n",
      "as I write, about twelve o’clock midnight, it may be said to\n",
      "be shining; and in the rays, with double winter clothing,\n",
      "it is really quite warm. But in the shade there are many\n",
      "degrees of frost; that is why the icicles hang so beautifully\n",
      "to-day over the blue ledges on the shaded side of the raised\n",
      "edges on the floes.\n",
      "It is a poor floe and feeble ice compared to that in the\n",
      "South. We passed a berg this afternoon, an Arctic berg, so\n",
      "we said: “How grand!” But in my mind I saw again the\n",
      "stupendous ice-cliffs of the South and their vast green caves,\n",
      "into which you could pack a dozen such Arctic iceberg chips.\n",
      "The atmosphere and colouring here remind me of the east\n",
      "coast of Scotland in June, clear, crystalline, unenveloping,\n",
      "quite unlike the velvety feeling of our west, towards the\n",
      "Gulf Stream, say down the Wigtownshire coast, or the west\n",
      "of Spain.\n",
      "I have often seen this scenery depicted in old whaling\n",
      "pictures, where the ships and whalers look quite large in\n",
      "proportion to the ice-forms. This is the difference between\n",
      "Arctic and Antarctic. In one, man and his vessels dominate\n",
      "the scene, in the other the great forms of nature make man\n",
      "and his works seem very small.\n",
      "This afternoon with my pistol I shot an old female seal\n",
      "through the brain—this after a futile stalk of hours for a seal\n",
      "in the morning with long-range rifle and telescope sight.\n",
      "Though we can’t find whales yet, the colour of the water is\n",
      "promising; it is full of plankton: if you draw a muslin\n",
      "net through it you collect in a few yards, in the tail of the\n",
      "bag, an almost transparent jelly—a minute quantity of\n",
      "which, examined under the microscope, reveals marvellous\n",
      "beauty, millions of minute crustaceans and diatoms that fill\n",
      "you with wonder at the life in the seas, which infinitely[254]\n",
      "surpasses in multiplicity the life of the land or the air. These\n",
      "probably form the food of the shrimps and little cuttle-fish,\n",
      "and the narwhals eat the cuttle-fish.\n",
      "The narwhal we caught the other day was full of small\n",
      "cuttle-fish, only about a few inches across the spread of their\n",
      "tentacles, and it also held red prawns or shrimps. But the\n",
      "cachalot or sperm whale of the warm seas kills very large\n",
      "cuttle-fish. We dare not say up to what size. I myself\n",
      "have only seen the sperm, after it has been harpooned, eject\n",
      "small cuttle-fish, but large circular marks in their backs,\n",
      "something like Burmese writing magnified, look as if they\n",
      "had been caused by the sucker on the tentacles of enormous\n",
      "cuttle-fish, and wandering grooves over their sides suggest\n",
      "that the parrot-like beak of the cuttle-fish has made its mark.\n",
      "I have seen one of these at least thirty-five feet in length.\n",
      "The contents of the stomach of many of the largest whales\n",
      "in the world, Balænoptera Sibaldi (Blue) and Balænoptera\n",

      "almost entirely of small shrimps, about one quarter of the\n",
      "size of the common shrimp. On the landing and flensing\n",
      "stage of Alexandra Company in Shetland, after several\n",
      "finner whales have been cut up, I have seen piles of this\n",
      "shrimp food lying on the slip, amounting to several tons\n",
      "in weight, with only, on rare occasions, a few minute fish\n",
      "amongst it all.\n",
      "The food of the whale that used to be more common up\n",
      "here, the Right whale, Balæna Mysticetus, is about the size\n",
      "of barleycorns and looks rather like sago with a brownish\n",
      "tint. The whale takes a mouthful of these, plus water,\n",
      "and squeezes the water through the blades of whalebone\n",
      "round the edge of its mouth, each of which has a fringe of\n",
      "hairs on the inside. These hairs, interwoven, make a surface\n",
      "to the palate like that of a cocoanut mat, which makes a\n",
      "perfect strainer. Then the whale swallows the mass of minute\n",
      "crustaceans that is left on its tongue and palate. The tongue\n",
      "is an immense floppy plum-coloured thing like a deflated\n",
      "balloon. I would give much to know exactly how its nerves\n",
      "and muscles act so as to work down the minute food from\n",
      "its palate into the throat. Smaller Finner whales we know[255]\n",
      "of, which feed on herring, round the Shetlands and British\n",
      "coast, locally called Herring Hog, or Springer, run to thirty\n",
      "feet or so. They are not hunted as yet by the modern\n",
      "whaler as they are rather too small to be worth towing to\n",
      "the station, but no doubt their day will come when our\n",

      "This chapter will show that it is foolish to sit up\n",
      "late, and that it does not do to shoot polar\n",
      "bears in pyjamas. Last night Hamilton and I\n",
      "sat up fairly late playing vingt-et-un for matches. But\n",
      "the Dons and De Gisbert sat up still later, almost all\n",
      "night, brewing a concoction of seal-oil and things on\n",

      "upset all over the shoulder of Don José junior’s coat.\n",
      "They were very merry, but they should have been in bed, as\n",
      "it was their morning watch at nine o’clock, and they went\n",
      "to bed not long before that hour. Spaniards are quite\n",

      "these late hours and for sleeping in pyjamas, for result.\n",
      "Soon after they had turned in, there appeared a very large\n",
      "she-bear and two cubs close to the floe-edge, which could\n",
      "have been shot from the bow. Just the chance they like,\n",
      "no horrid walking and stalking over snow. Gisbert was\n",
      "ready in a minute, but they lost the precious time getting\n",
      "out of the pyjamas into warm clothes, and the bear could\n",
      "not wait, and perforce they had to follow her over the snow\n",
      "and a fog came down.\n",
      "They have lost it; and here we are, a whole ship’s company,\n",
      "sleeping, or doing nothing but grousing and counting\n",

      "We are back to our last bear forest, “the woods are full\n",
      "of them,” as Hamilton says; back to bear-hunting because[257]\n",
      "there are no whales and because our path west and south\n",
      "and north is barred with ice. Perhaps by the middle of\n",
      "August there may be a road open to the land. We have seen\n",
      "the mist on the hills, at any rate a wide stretch of many\n",
      "miles of whitish light thrown up to the sky, which tells us\n",
      "that the land is there and that we are not more than fifty\n",
      "or sixty miles distant from it.\n",
      "We still hope to get the she-bear and the cubs; they\n",

      "we have on board; we could almost make pets of these\n",
      "small fellows.\n",
      "A man we know of got one a year or two ago. He was\n",
      "one of three Norwegians left on a certain island in these\n",
      "latitudes—we will not give its exact bearings—to collect\n",
      "skins during a winter. They got a hundred bearskins and\n",
      "ninety white fox of considerable value, and they are there\n",
      "still in barrels, and ought to be quite good yet. They lost\n",
      "their boat and were picked up and taken home. They had\n",
      "a baby bear, which they brought up on the bottle. It was\n",

      "came on the table. As the second lot arrived the steward\n",
      "stepped in rather quietly and whispered: “A seal astern,”\n",
      "so we jumped out with the pistol (by what some might call\n",
      "a lucky shot), hit it through the brain and it floated dead,\n",
      "and a white ivory gull hung over it. It was just the kind of\n",

      "The polar bear has usually two and sometimes three\n",

      "take little or no interest in the education of its young. Why\n",
      "the young, two or three year old bear we first caught\n",
      "showed such interest in the old bear, Hamilton’s first bear,\n",
      "I cannot quite understand, for though he kept half-a-mile\n",
      "to leeward he always seemed to have an eye lifting for the\n",

      "grotto—I remember we saw them standing on a high ridge,\n",
      "it must have been under this—into which they went, and\n",
      "were amused at the ghastly silvery appearance of their\n",
      "hands and faces. It was about fifteen yards long, and they\n",

      "with safety. The old Starboard bear is now mastering the\n",
      "material iron; teeth, he has learned, are no use, so he is\n",
      "applying brain. He eats sugar from our fingers, and would\n",
      "eat hand and arm with half a chance. I begin to sympathise\n",
      "with him in regard to confined quarters; even the wide space\n",
      "we have of about three square yards of deck, in which to\n",
      "have our exercise, feels confined after about five weeks’ time.\n",
      "I forget what we did or did not do in the morning of\n",
      "Sunday, 3rd August. I expect, the same as usual. There is\n",
      "thin mist, with sun shining through, an unhealthy mouldy\n",
      "morning, and we have a feeling as if we had had bad champagne\n",
      "the night before—a slight nasal catarrh, and a little\n",
      "sneezing going on amongst your neighbours and several\n",
      "complaints of rheumatism, cuts, and boils.\n",
      "[282]\n",
      "I have always heard the Arctic likened to atmospheric\n",
      "champagne, where men’s spirits are said to be high and colds\n",
      "exist not. Well, all I can say is that in this particular vessel\n",
      "in these latitudes (there again, there’s someone else sneezing)\n",
      "there are many such complaints, and smells! Hamilton\n",
      "says “The look of the sea suggests a smell.” It suggests to\n",
      "me London on a November morning. Sea and air are so\n",
      "stagnant and cold, you could lean against the icy smell of\n",
      "our bears or kitchen, and a cigar whiff almost strikes you.\n",
      "When the sun got up we steered away east and south—a\n",
      "hundred and forty miles we have yet to go, to get out of ice\n",
      "into the open sea, “the rough highway to freedom and\n",
      "to peace,” as Morris puts in his Jason, and all day we passed\n",
      "down lanes and lakes and across belts of deadly still water\n",
      "between floes of flat ice, with few and small hummocks.\n",
      "And seals became plentiful. As far as the eye could reach,\n",
      "occasional black marks could be seen on the floe and little\n",
      "black bullet-heads appeared in calm water at the floe-edge,\n",
      "and some of them came and examined us from thirty or\n",
      "forty yards as we passed, for an instant, and dashed under\n",
      "water again, leaving a swirl like the rise of a ten-pound trout.\n",
      "Yes, I think that was the whole day’s programme, excepting\n",
      "an alarm for bottle-nose whale. That came in the\n",
      "middle of aften-mad, seven or eight P.M., and we hastily\n",
      "loaded our two bow harpoon-guns, and got all ready and waited\n",
      "and watched, but the bottle-nose did not appear again. In\n",
      "several books on whales I see very misleading drawings of the\n",
      "bottle-nose whale, Hyperoodon diodon. This one is taken\n",
      "from notes of these whales in various seas, alive and dead.\n",
      "We were about to lay ourselves down to rest when a shout\n",
      "that a bear was in sight came from the mast-head, and all\n",
      "of us became very much alive.\n",
      "It was on a floe a mile off, and the floe was peppered with[283]\n",
      "seals, and it lay on its back and turned up the black soles\n",
      "of its feet and rolled about, apparently quite pleased with its\n",
      "own company, and indifferent to the seals.\n",
      "A remarkable thing happened when our little body of\n",
      "hunters set out after it—the seals lay on the ice, without\n",
      "popping into their holes, also other seals came alongside to\n",
      "within ten yards or so of the Fonix. It looked as if they\n",
      "knew that we were men bear-hunting. This struck me as\n",
      "odd up here. Of course in the Antarctic there would have\n",
      "been nothing remarkable; and Gisbert, who has been in\n",
      "Arctic ice scores of times, also thought it unaccountable,\n",
      "unless it was actually the case that the seals knew that we\n",
      "were in pursuit of their enemy.\n",
      "Still another thing extraordinary happened—we were\n",
      "watching the great old fellow stretching himself, and all\n",
      "his movements through the glass, noting his colour, light\n",
      "warm yellow, lighter than the violet of the floe in shadow!\n",
      "when he raised his black nose and face and went off at a\n",
      "walk to the left. I am sure he had not seen our guns or\n",
      "smelt them, it must have been that extra sense which the\n",
      "black bear also possesses—instinctive knowledge of a presence.\n",
      "Soon he came to a place where two of our men were\n",
      "visible to him and then, Hamilton tells me, he went off at a\n",
      "gallop! A great big male bear! It is a rare thing to see a\n",
      "bear gallop, I just missed doing so—took my glass off to\n",
      "make a note in colour, and he had got to a walk again when\n",
      "I put my glass on again. He made off fast to the left, where\n",
      "the floe ended, and about half-a-mile of calm sea and small\n",
      "bits of floe separated it from the next floe. This manœuvre\n",
      "left the two guns and the men far behind, so, to prevent his\n",
      "escape, we lifted our ice-anchor off the floe and steamed away\n",
      "to cut him off, and we got between him and the next floe\n",
      "when he was about a hundred yards from it, and so turned\n",
      "him back—a great big fellow swimming strongly, making a\n",
      "dark green wake behind him across the smooth bronze\n",
      "colour of the water—his last swim up the golden track of the\n",
      "midnight sun. Poor old man, the orange rays touched his\n",
      "pale face, and he looked anxious. I think the seals knew he\n",
      "was in difficulty, for several swam quite close to him, their[284]\n",
      "natural foe. We dropped a boat for the guns on the floe and\n",
      "they soon came up and opened fire at about twenty yards,\n",
      "and by-and-by a well-aimed shot hit in the neck. It is\n",
      "a male bear of great size—what an ignominious ending!\n",
      "But if you only think of the killing part, what hunting could\n",
      "be called sport? After all, it took Man much work to circumvent\n",
      "this ice bear—a ship built for ice work, then the\n",
      "engine, coaling and provisions for a year, and several weeks’\n",
      "navigation amongst the risks of sea and ice combined. He\n",
      "weighed eight pounds short of a thousand, stood on his\n",
      "heels from nose or eye nine feet two inches. He bore two\n",
      "old wound marks on his body, possibly made by Eskimos;\n",
      "we wonder if it was the memory of them made him go off\n",
      "so quickly; possibly it was only hunger and thoughts of\n",
      "dinner that at first disturbed him, for he had only a little\n",
      "seal’s skin inside him.\n",
      "It was the first time I had seen a bear look lighter in tone\n",
      "than the background; the sun being at a low angle, the\n",
      "undulating surface of floe was all lilac and tints of pale\n",
      "green, and yellow, and only the raised hummock and projections\n",
      "and the bear itself caught the golden light. The\n",
      "shadows on the bear’s body were comparatively dark green.\n",
      "So many people paint bears, and so few people see them in\n",
      "their natural surroundings that these colour notes may be\n",
      "pardoned.\n",
      "From one A.M. to five-thirty P.M. I heard at intervals in\n",
      "my sleep my Spanish friends fighting the battle over again,\n",
      "and occasional shots at seals. Their vitality is extraordinary\n",
      "(the Spaniards); they can talk for hours and hours\n",
      "without evincing the least sign of fatigue, whilst we poor\n",
      "northerners are creatures of habit and feel ready for bed\n",
      "after eighteen or twenty hours’ hunting; and we get tired of\n",
      "talking in a fraction of the time they spend yarning.\n",
      "They are rather bull-ring enthusiasts and back their bulls\n",
      "against any bear. Gisbert plans capturing one of these\n",
      "full-grown wild bears that are never seen in captivity and\n",
      "taking it to Madrid—more easily done than the reader would\n",
      "at first think, but it would be real sailor’s work. First of\n",
      "all you would find your big bear on a floe, which you could sail[285]\n",
      "round—easily enough done—and by one means or another\n",
      "get him to take to the water, also easily done. Then follow\n",
      "him in two boats, each would throw a lasso over his head,\n",
      "when the interest would begin. Whilst number one boat\n",
      "hauled taut he would probably roll over and thrash with\n",
      "his paws, then number two boat, with loop still fast to his\n",
      "neck, would throw a hitch over a foot, and so haul the foot\n",
      "to his neck, and so on with the other fore foot and hind feet;\n",
      "his head would then sink and hitches could be cast all over\n",
      "him, till, like a fly in spider’s web, he would be helpless. Then\n",
      "the big strop round him and a strong winch chain, a hold\n",
      "lined with iron plates and you would have such a bear\n",
      "as has never been seen in captivity, a floe-bred bear, say\n",
      "twenty years old, of huge dimensions. Gisbert, who knows\n",
      "all about bears as well as about bulls, backs the bear in the\n",
      "ring; so do I. Its four enormous limbs, each with a hand\n",
      "and claws on them, a neck and head and teeth of enormous\n",
      "power, all told three times the weight of a bull, and combined\n",
      "with cat-like activity and quickness of eye. Possibly\n",
      "next year this may come off and Hamilton and I will go down\n",
      "to Madrid and make a book, for all Spain would give any\n",
      "odds on their bull. In Madrid an elephant was pitted\n",
      "against a heroic bull; the bull at once charged and prodded\n",
      "the elephant, which annoyed it so that it swung round and\n",
      "broke the bull’s back with a swipe of its trunk. But a lion\n",
      "or black bear and a tiger the bull has easily mastered. A\n",
      "lion stood the charge and was lifted clean into the air and\n",
      "came down and bolted inside out with its tail between its\n",
      "legs. A tiger ignominiously fled, chivied by the bull all\n",
      "round the ring. So Madrid people are prepared to lay their\n",
      "shirts against any polar bears, or anything under the sun;\n",
      "they are in honour bound to do so.\n",
      "The bears they have seen in European zoological gardens\n",
      "have been brought as cubs, or at oldest were two years old,\n",
      "when they left their native floes, and are narrow chested and\n",
      "have narrow hips. Wait till they see the enormous proportions\n",
      "of chest and hind-quarters of a full-grown fellow\n",
      "that has lived, say, twenty to forty years, up north, with\n",
      "boundless liberty, on full rations!\n",
      "[286]\n",
      "Hamilton backs the bear to take a picador and horse under\n",
      "each arm, and the bull in his teeth, and our young Spaniards\n",
      "are a little offended at the picture, mais nous verrons, perhaps\n",
      "as soon as next year, if De Gisbert comes north hunting\n",
      "another season before the Spanish Government expedition\n",
      "starts.\n",
      "We continue to make our way towards the edge of the ice\n",
      "through the mist, till we come to quite an open space of several\n",
      "miles in width, where the slight roll from south-west tells us of\n",
      "the open sea to come, and we talk of our hopes of a smooth\n",
      "crossing to the north of Norway. The Dons make preparation\n",
      "for retirement, and divide their beer, apples and chocolate,\n",
      "kindly offering us a share. With great forethought they have\n",
      "preserved these provisions against the expected confinement.\n",
      "But I trust it may be sunny and smooth, for their sake.\n",
      "This day, the 5th of August, it is really hot in the\n",
      "sun, and there is a light air behind us, and there is only a\n",
      "very long, almost imperceptible swell—the sea silky blue,\n",
      "with delicate ripples, and the pans of floe ice are moving\n",
      "visibly, slightly dipping and rising, and the blue sea swells\n",
      "green over their white, as they rise, and hundreds of little\n",
      "streams run off them like icicles. “This end of the garden”\n",
      "is to-day very fresh and delicious, and after all these weeks\n",
      "of fog and nasty weather we hang up our bodies, as it\n",
      "were, to dry, and lay out our souls to the sun and thank\n",
      "the Creator for life. Life in a fog in the Arctic in the part\n",
      "where we have been is small beer, it is impossible to be truly\n",
      "thankful for the permanent possibility of sensation.\n",
      "[287]\n",
      "After several weeks’ trying to get through the ice\n",
      "we failed to get ashore, owing to there being twenty\n",
      "to sixty miles of fixed land ice, and now have worked\n",
      "our way back eastward through three hundred miles of pack\n",
      "and floe ice. By luck we might have found part of the coast\n",
      "free of ice, or only a few miles of it, but apparently, instead\n",
      "of this drifting south and giving some rain to the British\n",
      "Isles, southerly and easterly winds have held back the South\n",
      "Polar ice-drift. Eight to ten miles off the coast of Shannon\n",
      "Island, on the north-east of Greenland, was as far west as we\n",
      "could press; other navigators have taken almost the same\n",
      "course and have found as little as only fifteen miles of ice\n",
      "to shove through between Norway and Greenland.\n",
      "Yesterday we got the open sea and swell and now, as I\n",
      "write, we have come in contact with ice from north of Spitzbergen,\n",
      "and the ice from Siberia coming round north and\n",
      "south of Spitzbergen, and it is so plentiful that we are\n",
      "obliged to go north-east to find an opening easterly.\n",
      "All afternoon we have been trying to find an opening and\n",
      "till six or seven could not see a way through, and ice coming\n",
      "from north jammed us considerably, but it was light pack,\n",
      "not more than four or five deep, so our ship, little as it is,\n",
      "was able to hold her own. You could by its thin and flat\n",
      "appearance at once distinguish the Spitzbergen ice from\n",
      "older, heavier polar ice, which we just left to the west.\n",
      "Now, at seven in the evening, we have struggled through,\n",
      "and are leaving all Arctic ice behind. The pieces get smaller\n",
      "and smaller as we approach the open sea, till at the sea-edge\n",
      "there is only a margin of, say, a mile or so, studded with small\n",
      "pieces a few feet wide, and then again there is a further\n",
      "margin still smaller, remnants that were once hummocks\n",
      "or even parts of some iceberg. Then even these faint\n",
      "sentinels of the Arctic fade away behind us in a pale line,[288]\n",
      "and we are free and in a handsome, rolling, free-born, deep-sea\n",
      "true-blue ocean swell. Everyone is pleased. One is bound\n",
      "to admit that at any time in the ice there is, especially to one\n",
      "who knows about it, an indefinable sense of strain. This\n",
      "strain, slight as it is, expresses itself in our crowd. De Gisbert\n",
      "is playing “The Cock o’ the North” on the mouth melodeon,\n",
      "with great go; the writer has just adapted the old sea chantey\n",
      "to the bagpipes, “What shall we do with a Drunken Sailor,”\n",
      "and a violent desire to excel at lasso-throwing has seized\n",
      "Archie, and so on.\n",
      "Even our home, lately so sedate and dignified and restrained\n",
      "in its movements in amongst the ice, has taken a\n",
      "jolly seaman-like lurch and roll. The crow’s nest and mast,\n",
      "shining in the sun, go swinging to and fro across the sky—now\n",
      "she puts her nose down into the blue, pleasantly, and\n",
      "rises and our old level horizon of the ice days is away below\n",
      "us as our bows point to the skies—right and left we roll and\n",
      "we swing her south-east, for habitable land, for Trömso\n",
      "and Trondhjem and green trees growing and new fresh food;\n",
      "for even a few months in the ice with food getting rather stale\n",
      "makes us hanker a little after a new kitchen. We are tired\n",
      "of eating bear and of looking at their legs, which adorn our\n",
      "shrouds, great red-black limbs that we see all day swinging\n",
      "against the sky and eat slices of at every meal. Eating and\n",
      "seeing dead bear and hearing and smelling the living captives\n",
      "twenty-four hours of the day is too much of a good thing,\n",
      "so this is why we hanker after a new kitchen.\n",
      "I dislike a storm at sea, but I do confess I love the sea\n",
      "when it is smooth and blue, and it soothes you with a long\n",
      "gentle roll such as we have to-day.\n",
      "Our Last Glimpse of the Ice\n",
      "It looks as if we were to have a smooth crossing to Norway,\n",
      "still the fiddles must come down from our cabin walls and\n",
      "again grace our little table. For in a small boat such as\n",
      "ours every yachtsman knows that they are inevitable whilst\n",
      "deep-sea sailing. Gisbert cleans his rifle and the fiddles are\n",
      "on the table! so we are really done with the Arctic in the\n",
      "meantime. He and I each used our rifles an hour or two ago\n",
      "in the ice. No one knew who was to shoot at a seal on a floe\n",
      "that possessed a coat we all envied; we were rapidly passing,[289]\n",
      "so someone had to shoot and that quickly, so Gisbert and I\n",
      "dived for our respective rifles, and each loaded at the same\n",
      "instant and each fired as we swung past at eighty yards,\n",
      "and each within the hundredth part of a second, and each\n",
      "hit the seal in the middle. Neither of us knows which was\n",
      "the vital shot. We shoved the ship’s head against the floe\n",
      "and a man clambered over the bow and made a lasso fast to\n",
      "the seal. It seems a small matter to pot a seal on an ice-floe,\n",
      "but I would give many pounds, shillings and pence to\n",
      "be able to pass on the beauty of the colouring of that chunk\n",
      "of ice and green and lilac reflections in the purple sea, the\n",
      "silvery grey of the seal sparkling in the sunlight on the snow,\n",
      "and the reflected white light on the pink face of the man who\n",
      "jumped on to the ice to bring it aboard. The Prophet, we\n",
      "call him, a typical Norseman, with blue eyes, bushy yellow\n",
      "eyebrows, yellow hair and a kindly expression—he may be\n",
      "thirty years old, he might be a thousand—he is a type. His\n",
      "prophecies almost always come true. “It will be better\n",
      "before it is worse.” “We will get another bear before\n",
      "Gisbert cleans his rifle,” and so on. Remarks such as above\n",
      "are more interesting in his broken English—our steward’s\n",
      "broken English this morning almost rose to the level of\n",
      "punning. Archie Hamilton asked him sympathetically how\n",
      "he had slept—Archie, Gisbert and the steward all sleep in the\n",
      "fore part of the deck-house, and the bears are just outside.[290]\n",
      "Gisbert snores, and the steward coughs alarmingly, and\n",
      "the bear shouts, so Archie says he has not slept a wink for\n",
      "nights. “Nay, nay,” said Pedersen, “no mans can sleep,\n",
      "der is Gisbare, he go snore, snore, und dem fordumna ice-bears\n",

      "noddings!”\n",
      "At night we are in the open sea, rolling south-east, and try\n",
      "to hit off the north of Norway somewhere. The sun almost\n",
      "sets now, there is at any rate the warm glow of sunset, it\n",
      "pours into our two cabin ports from the north, making two\n",

      "quite green in contrast.\n",
      "The guitar is mended, the glue gave way with the fog\n",
      "in the ice and the heat of the stove combined. So again\n",
      "we have music, Gisbert the principal performer, the writer\n",
      "causing some surprise at his remembering part of a Spanish\n",
      "love song picked up in Southern Spain. Gisbert sings a\n",
      "number of these queer folk-songs, with their strange airs\n",
      "and unexpected intervals and the beat of Africa in the\n",
      "heart of them.\n",
      "I insert the scrap referred to above. It is not everyone\n",
      "who cares for this minor music, but it draws tears to a\n",
      "Spaniard’s eyes; and it appeals to the writer, inexplicably,\n",
      "for we have no music like it in our country.\n",
      "The words amount to this: that in love, the eyes are as\n",
      "eloquent as the lips.\n",
      "We have to play and hum tunes to keep our minds off\n",
      "the deep sea roll, that after the stillness of the ice comes\n",
      "as almost too much of a good thing.\n",
      "[291]\n",
      "To-day it is almost rough, a fresh north-east breeze,\n",
      "and as our little ship rolls far and often in a swell,\n",
      "or anything like a sea, strong men turn pale and say\n",
      "they feel a little tired and will go and lie down.\n",
      "Killers appeared at middag-mad, and but for the excusable\n",
      "lassitude of our party we might have tried for one, even\n",
      "though it is a little rough for accurate harpooning. Their\n",
      "great black fins, “gaff-topsails,” sailor-men call them, cut\n",
      "through the water with a spirt of foam like a destroyer’s bow.\n",

      "cut across between the nose and eye, or corner of its mouth,[310]\n",
      "the section would be like this. These hairs intertwine\n",
      "and form a surface to the palate like a well-worn cocoanut\n",

      "ton of water thick with small shrimps, partially closes its\n",
